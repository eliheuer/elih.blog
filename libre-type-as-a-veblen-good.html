    <h1>Libre Type as a Veblen Good</h1>
    <p>August 3, 2022</p>
    <p>I have been experimenting with new business models for independent free/libre/open-source font development using NFTs. Enough people have been curious about what I'm doing that it seems like the right time to put some of my thinking into an essay. I'm not going to go into much detail about the thinking behind libre type, but anyone involved in the font business who wants to understand this stuff should read Dave Crossland's 2008 University of Reading MATD Dissertation and Richard Stallman's 1985 GNU Manifesto. I also won't go into detail explaining NFTs, but Type Designer and founder of the MFEK font editor project Fredrick Brenan has some good commentary on NFTs here.</p>

    <p>In economic theory, goods are often classified based on their unique economic properties. Fonts, particularly for the Latin script, are commonly sold as snob goods, a good where the main attraction is related to its image of being expensive, exclusive, and a symbol of social status. These goods will have a restricted supply and only be available to people with high income. Snob goods have the property that as more people people buy (or pirate) them, the desirebility of that good decreases. For example, there  was a time when the typeface Favorit was fresh and new. Being a standard neo-grotesque with a few distinctive characters, it's use was a way for publishers to signal taste and class to consumers in-the-know. But over time, as more people become familiar with the typeface, and more people buy pirate and use the typeface, newer, less rinsed neo-grotesque go on the market and become more attractive to snob goods consumers.</p>

    <p>Libre fonts are free, open-source fonts usually licenced under the SIL Open Font License. Dave Crossland wrote a great dissertation on the subject, so I won't go into it inore.detail</P>

    <p>Nobody is forced to be a proprietary type designer. Most of us cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street and making faces. But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives standing on the street making faces, and starving. We do something else.</p>
    <p>I like libre fonts. I like being able to modify them, combine them (think Arabic + Latin), get them for free, use them in open source work, and avoid complicated licenses and CDNs. I have worked as a front-end developer before, and dealing with proprietary font can be a nightmare and a huge drain on the and tlenergy. Now this decade it looks like machine learning will be a major. In my way of thinking, open source licenses will be by far the most common way fonts are licensed and distributed in the near future, so I have been experimenting with</p>
    <p>I'm not the only one, I notice typefaces like inter, bungee, and pillowlava all over the place.</p>
    <P>I noticed there were a lot of issues around incentives that could be improved. I was shocked and dismayed to see how th</p>
    <p>To many professionals in the front industry I have observed, open-sourse is just a box to check on a list of requirements, the work will be done in a private GitHub repo, proprietary software that only works on Apple computers will be used, and potential collaborators on GitHub will be treated with scorn and contempt.</p>
