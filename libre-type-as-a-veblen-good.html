    <p>I have been experimenting with new business models for independent libre (open source) font development recently. I had my first hint that these models might work when my project <a href="https://gtl.world">GTL Type Label</a> minted all 100 editions of its first <a href="https://create.zora.co/editions/0xb013e4f218760bb72f63f8d78a82b546c91897ef">font NFT</a>. Enough people have been curious about what I'm doing since then that it seems like the right time to put some of my thinking around <a href="http://davelab6.github.io/matd-dissertation/dave_crossland_matd2008_dissertation.pdf">libre type</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> into an essay.</p>

    <p>I'm not going into much detail here about the philosophy behind libre type and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">why I sometimes use the word "libre" instead of "open source"</a>, but I think that the cultural nature of typefaces, and the way they lend themselves to being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">forked</a> to create new typefaces, makes fonts uniquely well suited to be licensed under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> license like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License">OFL</a>. Two documents are foundational to my thinking about licensing for font software and are recommended reading for anyone who wants to better understand my perspective:</p>
    <!--<p>We do need better busness models and incentive structures so more type designers and font engineers will consider releasing work this way, so I don't blame you if you are skeptical, but hopefully this essay will get at least a few people to roconsider their preconcived notions about libre fonts.</p>

    <p>I'm not a free software <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html">maximalist</a>, and I'm well aware of the shortcomings of the ideas from the above documents in practice, as well as the problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license">permissively licensed</a> open-source software around value capture for developers and software freedom for users. Without my experiences and disappointments with the reality of free and open-source software development, I'm not sure if I ever would have become interested in <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a>. What attracted me to this space was a culture interested in solving many of the misaligned incentives that I have noticed in <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/">web2</a> free and open-source software development. Specifically, projects like <a href="https://gitcoin.co">GitCoin</a>, and concepts like <a href="https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html">Hyperstructures</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3YQw15JK7Q">NFTs</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dao">DAOs</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/jzhycnEuJq4">quadratic funding</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">retroactive public goods funding</a> were all very interesting to me as I fell down the crypto rabbit hole.</p>

    <p>My hope is this stuff could enable global open/public coordination on large-scale, multi-script font projects at a quality level so high, it's not even possible today with corporate funding. All while improving compensation and working conditions for type designers and eliminating gatekeepers and middlemen in the process. To quote Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin: "Even a billion dollars of capital cannot compete with a project having a soul."</p>
    <!--<p>Remove this? Before moving on, I want to paraphrase one line from the GNU Manifesto that is important for understanding this essay. Nobody is forced to be a type designer. Most of us cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street and making faces. But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives standing on the street making faces, and starving. We do something else.</p>

    <p>Below is the tweet anouncing the first font NFT from <a href="https://gtl.world/">GTL</a>. The image associated with the NFT is a black and white specimen showing the typeface <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/GTL001">GTL001</a> at its <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/GTL001/releases/tag/Alpha">alpha release</a>. The image was created with a Python script using <a href="https://github.com/justvanrossum/drawbot-skia">DrawBot-Skia</a>, a version of <a href="https://www.drawbot.com">DrawBot</a> that works on Linux. The script is included in the <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/GTL001/blob/main/documentation/Alpha-NFT.py">GTL001 Git repository</a> if you want to use it or just take a look at how the image was made. I like this way of working beacuse I can automate rerendering all the images for a project using as Bash script, and anyone in the future that forks or contributes to this project will have human readable Python source files to work from, and won't need a Mac, Figma, or any Adobe products to use the source files. The auxiliary monospace text is set in <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/hasubi-mono">Hasubi Mono</a>, a Arabic/Latin monospace typeface I designed, which I'm currently preparing for a relese on Google Fonts.

    <p>In economic theory, goods are often classified based on their unique economic properties. This essay focuses on three categories: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">public goods</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good">veblen goods</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snob_effect">snob goods</a>. Fonts, particularly for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries">creative industries</a>, are commonly sold as snob goods using proprietary licenses and end user license agreements(EULAs). A snob good is expensive, exclusive, a symbol of social status, and decrease in value of as more people buy them and use them, particulary if the people using the font have low levels of social capital. </p>
    <p>Minority-scripts without many quality fonts on the proprietary market or libre alternatives are obviosly not snob goods, but specifically for Latin an other major global scripts I feel like there is at least some truth here. Aesthetic appeal, OpenType features, and unicode support alone can motivate someone to buy a proprietary font, but the brand of the designer/foundry and a mimetic desire for the typeface as a symbol of social status often comes before any objective ideas about quality.</p> 
    <p>The childrens story The Snetches illustrates this effect. A graphic designer and entrepenure enters a society of Snetches and starts selling them access to a machine that puts stars on their bellies. The first few to get the stars get a bost in social capital and self esteem. Then as more and more Snetches start getting stars, the desierablity of having a star wears off to the point where the entrepenuer starts charging for access to a machine that removes stars. The snetches then get caught in a trend cycle and spend too much money geting and removing stars in an atempt to gain social capital. Now just replace bellies with books and stars with low-contrast grotesque with a few distinctive recognizable characters, and I think you will get what I'm talking about.</p>
    <p>This is why Massimo Vignelli only used a narrow range of typefaces. Critisisms of Vignelli often focus on the specific typefaces he used, or the number of typefaces, but this misses the point in my opinion. The important part about his self imposed limitations is his attempt to break out of the consumer trend cycles the proprietary font industry creates. I have always liked the idea of self-imposed limitations employed by both Stallman and Vignelli, and I try to emulate them by using as much free/libre/open-source software as possible in my own design work.</p>
    <p>For all it's failings, I think the beautiful thing about modernist design was it's early egalitarian aspirations and attempts to live in harmony with technology in a way that wouldn't crush the human spirit. I see these early modernist impulses in both libre software and web3/blockchain technology, and find a lot of hope in them beacuse they both negate the top-down perscriptivness modernism is comonlly acused of.</p>

    <p>Snob goods  have the property that as more people buy (or pirate) them, the desirability of that good decreases. This can result in type founderies spening a lot of time and energy policing access to the infinity copyable font files acociated with their typefaces. Artificial scarsity must be maintained for this bussness model to work, leading to foudries treating their customers like criminals and burdinging them with unbelivably complex licensing schemes and complience requierments.</p>
    <p>It all sounds a lot like the greater fool theory and "dumping on retail", exactly what people like Bill Gates acuse crypto of when they dismiss it (He didn't think free and open source software had a future either, and now microsoft owns GitHub).</p>

    <!--
    <p>The final paragraph of Dave Crossland's MATD Thesis sugests an alternative, and beacuse I worry most people in the font indstry have never actully finished reading it, i will quote him here:</p>
    <p>"While today‚Äôs professionals use proprietary business models, the biggest problem facing new type designers is obscurity. Treating customers as friends rather than thieves and type design as a service instead of a product may prove an effective way for newcomers to enter the market while reinforcing a free society in the age of computer networks."</p>

    <p>What I'm trying to do with this approch is to create two seprate but linked goods with different economic properties, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">public good</a>, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good">veblen good</a>. Libre fonts are best understood in economic terms as public goods, here is the definition of public goods from Wikipedia (also a public good):</p>
    <p>"In economics, a public good (also referred to as a social good or collective good) is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. For such goods, users cannot be barred from accessing or using them for failing to pay for them. Also, use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others. Therefore, the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person. This is in contrast to a common good, such as wild fish stocks in the ocean, which is non-excludable but rivalrous to a certain degree."</p>

    <div class="caption">Image source: <a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1471509720280272897">Twitter</a></div>

    <p>And the definition of a veblen good, also from WikiPedia:</p>
    <p>‚ÄúA Veblen good is a type of luxury good for which the demand increases as the price increases, in apparent (but not actual) contradiction of the law of demand, resulting in an upward-sloping demand curve. The higher prices of Veblen goods may make them desirable as a status symbol in the practices of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure. A product may be a Veblen good because it is a positional good, something few others can own.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Ether (ETH), the native token used by the Ethereum blockchain, is itself sometimes considered a veblen good. As I'm writing this, The Ethereum mainnet merge, which will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by 99.95%, has been tentatively scheduled for around September 15th/16th 2022. The price of ETH earlier this year was around $1000 briefly, but with the merge date confirmed and the final testnet merge compleated, the price has grown to around $1900. I baught some ETH around 1000k (not nearly enough I now realize) but now at 1900k, my desier to buy ETH is much greater due to the increasing prices indication that other people want ETH. On the other hand, the software that runs Ethereum is a public good, this is the origin of the public/veblen good concept for me. Ethereum even uses a lot of copyleft licenses instead of permissive licenses for major parts of its ecosystem. Notably Go Ethereum AKA "geth", Solidity (the Smart Contract Programming Language), and the interface for Uniswap are licenses under the GPL-3.0 license.</p>
    <p>If a font released under this public/veblen good model ever becomes a meme or gets a lot of use, the Alpha release specimen might be worth something as a collectible in the future. This would reward the people who originally minted the NFT, which could encourage people to follow and support type designers using this model and opsosed to designers using traditional digital font licensing schemes beacuse it creates a more positive sum game. If the font doesn't go anywhere after the alpha release, it's a relatively inexpensive NFT (GTL001 was 0.009ETH at mint) that is a public receipt (viewable from web3 apps like Rainbow or Zora) for funding independent open source software development. Ideally, and this is what I'm really excited about, font NFT could create better incentive for contributing to open source font projects, a NFT holder might made issues on the Git repo hoping the floor price will go up for example. I'm in the process of adding a sign-in-with-Ethereum button to the GTL website, this would allow me to provide utility like bonus content, discounts on print specimens and merch, and earlt access to other NFT mints to people signed in that are holding specific NFTs.</p>

    <p>The final paragraph of Dave Crossland's MATD Thesis almost seems to predict a positive-sum bussiness model like this emerging, and beacuse I worry most people in the font indstry have never actully finished reading it, I will quote him here:</p>
    <p>"While today‚Äôs professionals use proprietary business models, the biggest problem facing new type designers is obscurity. Treating customers as friends rather than thieves and type design as a service instead of a product may prove an effective way for newcomers to enter the market while reinforcing a free society in the age of computer networks."</p>
    <p>I realize buying an NFT for a font that can be downloaded for free from a Git host like GitHub or Radicle might still seem insane to some people. Especially people looking at web3 from the outside, but imagine if no one had thought of proprietary font licensing as we know it today and tried to introduce it in 2022. It might seem strange to pay for an infinitely copyable font file, and then not have the ability to resell the license on a secondary market or make changes to the font to suit your own needs. Maybe font NFTs and proprietary font licenses are equally absurd ideas, one just seems normal because it is familiar and established.</p>
    <p>I think that the proprietary font model could also be improved with NFTs. I have never purchased a proprietary font before, but I have baught many Nintendo games on cartridges. The great thing about buying software this way is I can trade games with a friend, I can sell old games or trade them in for other games at GameStop, and sometime, if you hold onto old games long enough, they become colectors items that can be sold for lots of money!</p>
    <p>I can imagine a future where software like Figma has a sign-in-with-Ethereum button and you need to hold a specific NFT to use a proprietary font. That would be a lot easier than manually storing and keeping track of license files and information. Then you could have a secondary market for font licenses, I might actully buy my first proprietary font if I thought I could flip it for a profit.</p>

    <p>Since Dave Crossland wrote his dissertation in 2008, Libre fonts have expolded in popularity. Groups like Google Fonts, VTF, and OSP, and Alif Type have made magor contributions, along with lots of interesting amatures and semi-profesional type designers and font engineers who would have been excluded from the gatekept and secrative proprietary font industy.</p>
-->
    <p>I remember going to many type design lectures and classes at Cooper Union in the early-to-middle 2010s and hearing lots of complaints about Google Fonts and the OFL. As someone who is now an investor in crypto but didn't know the first thing about investing back then, I now recognize the sentaments expressed back then as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a>", fear uncertenty and doubt. Everyone does this, I'm as guily as anyone else. We are all aware of things happening in the world that could hurt us or help us with our careers or finances, and we conciously or uncociously promote the things that will help us and disparage the things that will hurt us when we speak. Today I hear a lot of similar FUD around NFTs in the font indusrty, and my my hope is just that more people will see past it and play around with new bussiness models using this technology. I'm excited to see what the libre type commons will look like by the end of this decade, in web3 everyone gets to be Dave Crossland for 15 minutes.</p>
<!--
    <p>Very few people back then thought there was any money to be made giving font files away for free. Even today, when many designers are comissed to create open source fonts by large corporations. They still do so using Mac only proprietary software, work in closed Git repositories only making them public at the end of the project and rarely updating them, and treat the idea of collaborating with amatures and semi-profesional with contempt and distain. We are still a long way away from the culture of sharing and cooperation envisioned by the early free software movment, but maybe, just maybe, playing positive-sum games with crypto economics can help us get there. I don't blame the individual designers and font engineer, to borrow another term from the crypto industry many have been "rugged" by expensive art schools and are just trying to pay back student loans under difficult circumstances (hopefully crypto and DAOs can disrupt art and design education soon). However, I think we are currently doing a lot of harm to culture and technology by insisting that many fonts must be licensed as proprietary software. To paraphrase the GNU Manifesto: Nobody is forced to be a proprietary type designer. Most of us cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street and making faces. But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives standing on the street making faces, and starving. We do something else.</p>

<!--
    <p>Libre fonts have many interesting properties not usually found in proprietary fonts. You can modify them and dedistribute you modifications. You can combine different scripts from diferent libre fonts together (think combing Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin into one font). You can download and use them for free, without the long list of. As a type designer you don't ever have to start from scratch, you can just find a libre font, make your own modifications, and republish your update somewhere like GitHub so someone else can use your work as a starting point.</p>
    <p>Machine Learning an AI technology in type design will be an interesting space to watch this decade, and with the OFL there is a lot of training data avaiable without restrictive licensing. Machine Learning and type design automation system using OFL fonts as input will be requiered by the terms of the OFL to license the output under the OFL, creating a nice flywheel to help build the libre font commons.</p>
