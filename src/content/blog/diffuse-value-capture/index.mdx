# Diffuse Value Capture

<p>“Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.”</p>

Imagine two people in an economy, Alice and Bob. They both work about 40 hours per week. Alice creates 10 units of value, but captures 9, almost all the value created. Bob creates 100 units of value, but only captures 10.

Alice captures 90% of the value created with 40 hours of work, while Bob captures 10% of the value created in the same amount of time, But Bob still captures more value than Alice.

The point of this example is that different attitudes and strategies for value capture are possible, and the optimal amount of value capture is rarely 100%, because the more you insist on capturing as much of the value as possible, the less value you create.

I stared at my laptop screen for three hours thinking about this. Value capture is weird. Like when you try to hold water in your hands. The tighter you squeeze, the more it slips through your fingers.

Our culture is becoming a remix culture again. I say "again" because remixing was the default for most of human history. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. They built on what came before without lawyers appearing to demand royalties.

Then copyright law emerged. People started thinking of ideas as property. Fences appeared in the commons of creativity. A songwriter could say, "This chord progression belongs to me now." And courts would agree, which feels absurd when you think about it for more than five seconds.

I remembered reading Lessig's "Free Culture" at a Starbucks in 2007. He described how copyright went from being a limited right to becoming an almost perpetual one. Mickey Mouse should have entered the public domain decades ago. He hasn't. The laws keep changing to protect corporate interests.

The internet was supposed to be this amazing space where culture could flourish freely. Then it became a series of walled gardens. Big tech companies built fortresses around content. They became the gatekeepers, the toll collectors.

But something interesting is happening now with AI and crypto.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

I think about this at 3 AM sometimes. Whether this is good or bad depends on your perspective. If you're trying to be Alice, capturing 90% of your small value creation, you probably hate it. If you're trying to be Bob, creating massive value and accepting diffuse returns, you might see it differently.

Crypto introduces mechanisms for capturing value from commons-based production. The blockchain doesn't care about exclusive rights. It cares about verifiable contributions. Someone can fork your code, but they can't erase your contribution history. Your work remains attributed to you on-chain, forever.

I saw a project last week where creators got micropayments whenever their work influenced new creations. Not by enforcing copyright, but by tracking contribution lineage. The system didn't prevent remixing; it just ensured that value flowed back to original creators when their work helped others.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

The permission culture that Lessig warned about—where you need approval for every creative act—is being bypassed by technology. You don't ask permission to train an AI on a dataset. You just do it. And the results become part of a new creative commons.

I'm typing this on my laptop at a coffee shop with bad lighting. I keep thinking about how weird it is that we tried to industrialize creativity in the first place. Ideas aren't like cars on an assembly line. They're more like conversations at a party. They get better when they're shared, modified, challenged.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.

This feels like what Lessig was advocating for all along. A culture where creativity is free—not free as in "no cost" but free as in "freedom to build upon." Where remix is the default. Where sharing doesn't mean stealing.

I drink my coffee and look out the window. I think about how much of my thinking is influenced by people I've never paid directly. Writers, musicians, artists, programmers. Their ideas shape mine. In the old model, this is a problem. In the new model of diffuse value capture, it's exactly how things should work.

The shift from direct to diffuse value capture isn't just economic. It's cultural. It's about recognizing that the most valuable creations often come from building on the work of others. That innovation thrives in an environment of openness rather than restriction.

I save the document and close my laptop. Tomorrow I'll think more about this. About how we might design systems that allow massive value creation while ensuring creators can sustain themselves. Not by capturing all the value they create, but by capturing enough of the much larger value they generate when they choose to share freely.
