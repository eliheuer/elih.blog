# Diffuse Value Capture  

Published May 15th, 2025

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>“Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.”</p>

## 1 Definitions

Diffuse—Widely spread out rather than concentrated; dispersed across many points, participants, or locations.

Direct value capture—many-to-one, closed, permissioned.

Diffuse value capture—many-to-many, open, permissionless.

Direct and diffuse value capture exist on a spectrum, extremes on both ends are almost always unworkable.

## 2 Thought Experiment

Alice and Bob both work 30 hours per week creating a similar digital good. They are trying to capture value in various forms like money and social capital.

|                | Alice | Bob |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| Hours worked   | 30    | 30  |
| Value created  | 10    | 100 |
| Capture rate   | 90%   | 10% |
| Value captured | <span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 64)">9</span> | <span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">10</span> |

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10%, but Bob still captures slightly more value than Alice—one whole unit—with the same amount of work. This is effective diffuse value capture.

There is no upper bound to the amount of value one person can create, so creating 1000 units and captureing 1%, or creating 1000000 units and captureing 0.001% would also work.

## 3 Authorship & Originality Also Exist on a Diffuse-to-Direct Spectrum

For most of human history, cultural production was diffuse. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. Authorship and originality were diffuse.

Before the printing press, many works circulated anonymously or under famous names to lend prestige. Scribes duplicated manuscripts without permission. Copying was so difficult and time consuming that limiting copying was not a problem. The culture of intellectual property was directly influenced by the current level of technology for copying information.

After the printing press was introduced to Europe, western cultural production has mostly become more direct as a result. Culminating in the pre-internet era of Hollywood, TV, the music industry, and publishing.

At the crest of this wave of direct culture, the personal computer was developed, and started a shift back towards diffuse culture. Not as a return to the pre-industrial models, but as new models that are only possible with decentralized global computer networks.

There was a 250 year gap between the European printing press and what we now recognize as contemporary IP law. So while timelines for cultural shifts are getting shorter, there is still a lag between technology and culture.

| Year | Tech/Event | Immediate Reaction | Lasting Legal Shift |
|------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1040 | Bi Sheng (畢昇) invents movable-type printing in China | Modest adoption due to thousands of Chinese characters | Limited impact on Chinese legal frameworks for copying |
| 1450 | Gutenberg's movable-type printing press | Explosion of vernacular Bibles, pamphlets; authorities panic over heresy. | None yet, copying suddenly cheap, rules nonexistent. |
| 1476 | Caxton sets up England's first press | Crown issues ad-hoc printing patents, but enforcement is patchy. | Still no copyright—control via favors & guilds. |
| 1517 | Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses | Printed and distributed across Europe, sparks Reformation. | Demonstrates power of print to bypass traditional gatekeepers. |
| 1557 | Royal Charter for the Stationers' Company | Guild monopoly lets Crown censor by licensing printers. | Corporate control substitutes for author rights. |
| 1662 | Licensing of the Press Act | Censorship tightens; printers need a license or face seizure. | Parliament grows wary of monopoly but has no alternative. |
| 1695 | Licensing of the Press Act Lapses | 14-year vacuum—anyone may print; pamphlet culture booms. | Chaos forces lawmakers in Parliament to rethink “who owns a text”? |
| 1710 | Statute of Anne | For the first time, authors, not printers, receive a 14-year exclusive right. | The birth of modern copyright—arrives 250 yrs after the printing press. |
| 1910 | Qing Copyright Code | Short-lived but modeled on European statutes | Real enforcement waited until the PRC's 1990 law |


We are only at the dawn of the internet today.

## 4 Neo-China Arrives from the Future

<p>“The seal stamps on old Chinese paintings are fundamentaly different from the signatures used in European paintings. Primarily they do not express authorship that might have authenticated the picture, therby making it unassailable. Instead, most seal stamps come from connoisseurs or collectors who inscribe themselves into the picture not only through their seal but also through their commentaries. Here art is a communicative, interactive practice that constantly changes even the artwork's appearance. Subsequent viewers of the picture take part in its creation.”</p>

<p>—Byung-Chul Han, [Shanzhai 山寨](https://youtu.be/hpADLkWvAHA), 2017.</p>
</div>

The diffuse-to-direct spectrum shifts regionally. The Far East has different views on authorship and originality that are not purely due to available technology and are rooted in ancient eastern religions and philosophies.

The Chinese idea of the original is less determined by a unique act of creation, but by a natural unending process, not by definitive identity but by constant change. Skillful reference signals knowledge, and originality is in nuanced re-combination, more than radical newness.

In November 2023, DeepSeek-AI open-sourced their DeepSeek-LLM models. These models already out-scored Meta's Llama 2 on code and reasoning tests. Fourteen months later it unveiled DeepSeek-R1, a 671 billion-parameter model that matched GPT-4 benchmarks. The company says the final training run cost under $6 million, far below below what U.S. flagships spend. Now a 100GB download and a few consumer GPUs are now enough to run and fine-tune a frontier-class model at home.

Western incumbents still cling to a direct value capture mindset—API call metering, secret weights, NDAs—while Chinese labs treat the model itself as advertising for downstream services, hardware, and prestige. Plus a thin layer of proprietary coordination that serves as alpha for their AI quant funds.

This is diffuse capture in action, and it arrives just as American IP maximalists and AI safetyists lose the plot trying to monopolize and control the AI industry.

Western critics call China’s loose stance on IP a drag on growth, yet in an AI-driven century it may prove prescient. Is it possible the West took the wrong path and anciant Chinese views on authorship and originality will be closer to what IP culture becomes by the end of the 21st century, more coslely resembling a naturalistic process of evolution than a God-like act of creation from a single source.

{/*
The "Chinese century" might not just be about GDP or rare-earth supply chains. It could be about open-source abundance vs closed-source scarcity, about diffuse value capture vs direct value capture.

Inside China the leadership insists the country is on the road to communism, and Marx’s “general intellect” is essentially an early theory of diffuse value capture and AI: collective knowledge, embedded in machines and networks, replacing individual labour as the chief source of wealth. He saw advanced free and open capitalism as closer to communism than the top down control we think of as communism in the west (withering away of the state). Much of the failures of the Left since Marx can be seen as a result of the tyranny and bureaucracy required by trying to solve the problems created by direct value capture with more direct value capture. Free market capitalism in an advanced state is communism, they are the same thing.

Open-source projects, public datasets, and shared weights are literal instantiations of general intellect. Innovation is cumulative and non-rival; every fork or remix enlarges the commons instead of depleting it. Because value now comes from a pool of shared code and models, attempts at direct capture (exclusive IP, closed weights) generate drag, while diffuse capture frees information to flow and amplifies the network. No totalitarian state is needed enforce diffuse or direct value capture, the free market will dynamicly shift to whatever works best given the current state of technology.

## 5 Neural Networks are Diffuse 

Contemporary culture, finance, and law are skewed towards direct value capture, but recent advancements in AI are starting to exacerbate longstanding flaws in this orientation. Neural networks are diffuse in nature, direct value capture does not map well onto them.

Art, music, code, design, and other cultural products, culled from the open web, are diffused across latent space. Once creativity is encoded as a multi-trillion-parameter fog, the idea that you can meter each droplet of inspiration the way you meter a DVD sale becomes economically and technically incoherent.

A neural network does not store information from its training set the way a database stores rows. Any given weight is meaningless in isolation; value only emerges from statistical interference among all the weights at once. Like pigments mixed into paint, the underlying sources are no longer separable, you cannot point to a specific coordinate and say this vector belongs to one copyright holder.

Listen to conversations about AI and intellectual property and you will see there is very little consensus on how to continue the current IP system in this new AI era. Calls for radical reforms that used to be relegated to the lunatic fringe are gaining traction in mainstream tech circles.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I agree</p>&mdash; gorklon rust (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1910840422789763511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The increasingly diffuse nature of cultural production and openness to new way of thinking about IP is a direct consequence of technological trends:

1. Increased dominance of decentralized networks over traditional media and finance. 

2. Massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm and inherently diffuse AI models.

3. Hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online.
 
This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet may slow it down, but never succeed in stopping it in any timeline.

## 6 The Hacker Ethic & Free Information

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The precepts of this revolutionary Hacker Ethic were not so much debated and discussed as silently agreed upon. No manifestos were issued. No missionaries tried to gather converts. The computer did the converting.</p>

<p>—Steven Levy, Hackers, 1984.</p>
</div>

Computers speak in copies and duplication costs effectively zero. When the medium itself is infinite replication, the default economic model can no longer be scarcity; it must be abundance and sharing.

The technology of computing has this "hacker ethic" imperative encoded in its architecture at the lowest level, just like neural networks are diffuse by nature.

Artificial scarcity created by legal means alone in the digital realm is an awkward simulacrum of real world scarcity. Forcing ideas around property from the physical world poses endless challenges and works against the grain of the medium. This primal unspoken orientation at the core of computing is what Richard Stallman later formalised as software freedom.

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>“We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.”</p>

<p>—Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto, 1985.</p>
</div>

Free software and its de-fanged off-shoot open-source have been at the core of comptuing culture ever since. As a result, programming culture has understood and adapted to shifts towards diffuse value capture better than other industries in recent history. While neighbouring professions have struggled to escape the 20th century mindset of direct value capture, and the emphisis on authorship and originality that comes with it.

Even within programming culture there’s a gap between who creates value and who captures it. Bill Gates’s fortune dwarfs that of Linus Torvalds or Richard Stallman, but the latter have provided significantly more value to computing and the world. In Gates’s famous letter to hobbyists, software sales are treated as naturally scarce products no differnt than hardware—diffuse models and the unique properties of software never cross his mind.

Despite it's masive success, even today free and open-source software culture has struggled to develop effective value capture and coordination systems. In many domains it is still a niche and has largely been relegated to controlled opposition, hobby projects, free/cheap labor, resume slop, and pawns in commoditize-your-complement schemes. The ecosystem still struggles to find native, diffuse ways to capture value and coordinate production.

Corporate patronage has been a primary driver of open-source development and a main way to capture value from open-source, but the dirrect value capture systems used by big tech works against the grain of the diffuse nature of open-source.

Corprate patronage is direct, there is a huge layer of burocracy and middlemen involved in the process. And everything must be acounted for in a way that is ledgible to middle managers of middle managers, this leads to blind-metric behavior where open-source develoeprs work to arbitrary metrics more than actualy creating value. This not only bogs down the process of open-source development, but it also creates a lot of friction in the open and collabrative nature of open-source.

When a open-source developer is linked into the dirrect value capture corporate patronage system, they are incentivised to stop sharing knowledge and working in the open in order to gatekeep their work and capture value for themselves. These developers have few incentive to help, mentor, or collaborate with others.

With diffuse value cature strategies, the incentives are aligned to help, mentor, and collaborate with others. The more knowledge you share, the more you help grow the ecosystem around your project, the more value you can capture. Gatekeeping is still necicary to a degree to protect community culture, but non-productive information asymmetry and cronyism that is the result of big tech's dirrect value capture systems has fewer financial incentives.

The coordination mechanisms requered to compete with the Apples and Nvidias of the world as fully open-source software organazations remains elusive, but the dream of things like the year of the Linux desktop refuse to die, and software like Blender has managed to thrive and almost monopolize their niche despite being underfunded. One notable exception being cyrpto, which is open-source and diffuse by nature, and has created and captured a staggering amount of value, but remains controvercial and unutilized in many free and open-source circles.

| 5 | Amazon | 2.2T | Technology |
| 6 | Bitcoin | 2.0T | Open-Source Commodity |
| 7 | Google | 1.9T | Technology |

It is notable that Google, the company that facilitated the "Attention is All You Need" paper that kickstarted the current AI hype cycle, has a market cap smaller than an open-source decentralized project with an anonymous founder. Many of the failure modes of direct value capture can be seen in Google, and cryptocurrancies are defying many of the failure modes of diffuse value capture. What is going on here.

## 7 Crypto & Diffuse Value Capture

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">

</div>

Technology should be deflationary, every efficiency and automation ought to push prices down in a compedative free market. Yet almost all goods and services feel noticeably pricier each year. Why is this.

In the United States, broad money supply (M2) grew roughly 40% between early 2020 and early 2025. Looking at the Fed's M2 money-supply data, the money stock rose from about 15.4 trillion in January 2020 to more than 21.5 trillion by early 2025.

More dollars chasing the same goods props prices up, masking the natural price-cuts technology and automation would deliver. Simply saving in a hard money (limited supply) asset like gold or Bitcoin is a simple bureaucracy free way to capture value diffusly from technology and automation.

Gold's main weakness as money is that it only solves scarcity—not speed or security in a digital world: it's heavy to ship, hard to divide finely, and expensive to verify, so people end up storing it in banks and using paper or electronic claims instead. That custody layer re-introduces the very counter-party risk, government control, and inflation-by-decree (through unbacked IOUs) that gold was meant to avoid, while still leaving holders exposed to confiscation and mining-driven supply growth—all problems a purely digital asset like Bitcoin sidesteps.

<Image 
  src={Gold} 
  alt="Gold" 
  width={1200} 
  height={675} 
  class="rounded-md"
/>

Bitcoin keeps the good parts of gold—limited supply and no reliance on a government—but removes the hassles. Its cap of 21 million coins means it can never be “mined” in unlimited amounts the way new gold gets dug up each year. You can verify, store, and move Bitcoin with a phone or computer instead of vaults, trucks, or border inspections, and you can divide it down to a hundred-millionth of a coin to pay for small things. Because it's scarcer, easier to send, and harder to seize than gold, Bitcoin is in many ways a better store of value for a digital, global economy.

Besides Gold, real estate is another long term capital preservation strategy. Houses are non fungible, non transportable, and non divisible, and not instatly liquid. Ownership is taxed, and there is constant maintenance and upkeep, plus risk of natural disasters and other catastrophes. Like Gold Bitcoin has many advantages over real estate.

When single family homes become a store of value, a monetary premium is added on top of their use value as a place to live, and people end up spending more money than necicary just for basic shelter.

Cheap housing is a method of diffuse value capture, it allows people to persure activities that involve less direct value capture, like maintaining independent open-source software or creating new inventions without overly restrictive IP attached. In a way, they diffusly capture value via affordable housing. This dynamic is what we have seen in major culture industry centers like NYC and Berlin, low-cost living initially allows for more diffuse value capture activites like art, music, and experimental tech, these activites diffuse into these cities making them more disierable to live in. This creates a positive feedback loop of diifuse value capture that lasts until housing becomes too expensive and all the diffuse value capture activites are replace with dirrect value capture activites, eventually extinguishing the things that made that area desirable in the first place.

Many people involved with Real Estate in these situations are simply wealthy people that need somewhere to put their money where it wont lose value over time, and ideally gain value. If Bitcoin and other cryptos have better long term capital preservation properties than Real Estate, why not just put all your money into crypto? This would be a boon for diffuse value capture and hosing affordability, which is a major quality of life issue for many people.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I&#39;m going to list this median house for 3x what the median family can afford.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/TCW9XeV8Q2">pic.twitter.com/TCW9XeV8Q2</a></p>&mdash; Darth Powell (@VladTheInflator) <a href="https://twitter.com/VladTheInflator/status/1912284080978423927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Things like S&P 500 ETFs and the Boglehead investing strategy can be seen as primitive forms of diffuse value capture fully aligned with mainstream capitalism. It's a way to capture value from the economy in aggregate with minimal bureaucracy and middlemen. Whatever value you create but fail to capture, maybe Google and Microsoft will capture that value and you can get some of it back through a broad market index.

The S&P 500 has a similar problem to Real Estate, it is used as a store of value and a way to beat inflation, instead of its original use case, investing in inovative companies. So equities gain a monetary premium over their value as a speculative investment. This can artaficially inflate and distort the market, making market data less useful and extend the life of companies in the market after the have stopped inovating and have become stagnant bureaucracies.

Is Apple after Steve Jobs really a good speculative investment with it's best days ahead of it in 2025, worthy of a 3.1T market cap? What part of Apples value is just ETF's in retierment accounts, and what part is people that really belive in Apples current ability to innovate? Wouldn't we live in a better world if the stock market returned to being about speculative investments in inovative companies, instead of giant monopolies that have become too big to fail due to their use as a store of value?

| Rank | Asset | Market Cap | Type |
|------|-------|---------------------------|------|
| 1 | Gold | 21.7T | Physical Commodity |
| 2 | Microsoft | 3.3T | Technology |
| 3 | Apple | 3.1T | Technology |

| 5 | Amazon | 2.2T | Technology |
| 6 | Bitcoin | 2.0T | Open-Source Commodity |
| 7 | Alphabet | 1.9T | Technology |

The equity market has many more problems that work agaist diffuse value capture. Most of the best investment are not avaiable to the average person, private equity and venture captial gatekeep the best returns. You need to be an accredited investor to invest in private equity, and even then you need to be able to afford the minimum investment amounts. The public market is basicly just private equity selling to the public after all the good returns have been captured by the insiders.

Even today, the avergae American can't invest in most of the AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, retail investors that want AI exposure are forced into proxies like NVIDIA, but NVIDIA stock is a bet on their proprietary dirrect value capture strategy and not specificcly a bet on AI.

In the US, investors are allowed to buy lottery tickets and gamble at casinos, but are protected from early acess to startup equity supposidly for their own good. The whole TradFi system is simply too closed, proprietary, and gatekept to facilitate diffuse value capture at the scale that AI and other technologies will require.

The TradFi equity market is closed, proprietary and gatekept by nature, with anciant and complicated infastructure that only works durring east coast bussines hours. Of couse this is rationalized in various ways by the people that profit from it, but to me it is clear that global captialism needs open, fair, permissionless, and global 24hr financial infastructure.

After Bitcoins success, many more blockchains developed, featurings smart contracts and decentralized applications with the potental to replace the traditional finance system with open-source infastructure, much like open-source software won on the server side of computing in the 90's.

These systems are open and diffuse by design, just like computers are aligned with free information and copying at their core, and nerual networks are diffuse by nature, open-source decentralized blockchain platforms are diffuse by design. Where Bitcoin is like digital gold, Etherum is more of a public world computer.

Ethereum allows anyone to create a token, a smart contract that can be traded using decentralized open source infrastructure. These systems go far beyond trading and are technical marvels of the open source world and diffuse value capture. For example anyone holding two tokens can become a liquidity provider and facilitate permissionless swaps of these tokens on decentralized open source exchanges. Liquidity providers can set their own swap fees and earn yeild on their tokens in exchange for the risk and work of providing liquidity. This is massivly empowering when you consider that it is completly ungatekept like the banking world, and that banks whole bussiness model is earning yeild on the money you deposit in your checking and savings accounts.

Ethereum lets anyone deploy a programmable token (an ERC-20 smart contract) that is immediately tradable on open, permissionless exchanges. Holders can pool two tokens in an automated market-maker like Uniswap, set (or accept) a swap fee, and earn a share of that fee for supplying liquidity—no bank or broker in the loop. The yield that banks normally pocket on deposits flows straight back to participants, a textbook case of diffuse value capture.

Banks are classic dirrect value capture systems, and decentralized finanace is and alternative to the traditional banking system that sits on the diffuse value capture side of the spectrum.

But Ethereum is a world computer, it's uses can be extended far beyond finance to art and culture. One of the tokens with the highest market cap on the Ethereum blockchain is 0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933, $PEPE.

Pepe the Frog is a prime example of the shift from direct to diffuse culture. The character was created by Matt Furie in 2005 as a character in a comic book called Boy's Club. Pepe's origin was by the book direct culture, one creator and a character in a world fully controlled by the creator.

It is worth noteing however, that Matt Furries artstyle is a pycadelic blend of the kind of media that Gen X and elder millenials watched on TV in the 80's. When you look at his work you can vaguely recognize versions of pop culture characters like Jim Henson's Muppets, Ronald McDonald, Skeletor, Freddy Krueger or Falcor from the Never Ending Story, but diffused through Matt's own unique lens. In this way he is an interesting checkpoint in a shift from direct to diffuse culture. Even the character he clearly refrenace were themselves built on the backs of other creators. This is a core tension in direct value capture systems, everything is a remix or other things at some level, but dirrect value capture requiers a certin level of abstraction to meet leagl requierments.

The Pepe the frog character became an internet meme when his popularity steadily grew across websites such as Myspace, 4chan and Tumblr from 2008 onwards; by 2015, he had become one of the most popular memes on the internet. The character grew and evololved in a decentralized memetic way, without a central authority, and completly without the intent of the original creator.

This culminated in Pepe becoming a symbol of the alt-right and and Matt using his copywrite to try and the use of the character by these groups. Matt had some legal sucsesses but ultimatly the character has escaped his control and the nature of the internet made containment imposible. In an interview with Esquire, Furie said of Pepe's usage as a hate symbol, "It sucks, but I can't control it more than anyone can control frogs on the Internet"

In late April of 2023, in a crypto market that was in the midst of a bear market after the collapse of FTX, a PEPE memecoin was launched on Ethereum and quckly reached a market cap of 1.6 billion dollars by early May. Today, two years later it has a market cap of 5.5 billion dollars down significantly from it's all time high of 11 billion dollars in late 2024.

I was closly following the token at the time, and what I saw was a glimpse the potenal for crypto to be used as a diffuse value capture system. The memecoin served as a thin minimun-viable-product coordination and incentive mechinism on top ot a diffuse cultural phenomenon. All of a sudden people were able to capture value from a meme in a way that was not possible before.

## 8 Post-Authorship

The further you move in the direct value capture direction of the spectrum, the more you need to rely on your identity as a singular human to capture value. This is often at odds with how cultural production works in the real world. 



In the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0, there was a lot of hype about commons-based peer production. The idea was that with the rise of the personal computer and the internet, we would see a new wave of cultural production that was not centered around the traditional gatekeeper model of hollywood and the music industry. Anyone online could colaborate with others to create new works of art.

When direct value capture is your goal, your identity as a singular human becomes extremely important. You are the center of the universe. You are the source of all value. You are the one who is entitled to capture the value created by others.

Trying to capture as much value as possible usually doesn't work well in the free market. An example I often use is that of font designers selling proprietary fonts with complicated and expensive licensing. This direct value capture strategy leads to extreme beliefs about authorship and originality, when in reality, the design of fonts is extremely memetic and every design is a remix of other designs. A truly unique font design that isn't built on a mountain of prior work and free and open-source software is almost impossible to find.



The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, making it difficult to price, and easy to copy. Early attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

Distributed authorship is the future because it's a direct consequence of technological trends, as all culture follows from: increased dominance of decentralized content distribution networks over traditional media, massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm, hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online, all work to erode the artificial attempts to extend the pre-digital one-to-many media paradigm surviving now only through the dubiously defensible and ethically incoherent distortions of IP/copyright law pushed by legacy media companies and the vague pseudomarxist anti-AI youth political movement, both against the heavier political weight of the tech industry; not to mention rising Chinese soft power and global financial multipolarity. I've argued this is the future of culture for a decade because these trends were all obvious a decade ago and it's now so obvious today it feels trite to repeat, yet here we are. This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet—global networking, open content distribution, digital free association, runaway self-organizing culture—may slow it down, but it never succeeds in stopping it in any timeline.

## 9 Incentivizing post-authorship commons-based peer production.

AI, blockchain, and post-authorship diffuse culture are converging, and I belive we will see a super charged new wave of commons based peer production as a result.

Working for your bags.

I naively still believe in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

In digital markets the marginal(additional) cost of producing the next unit often approaches zero. Once the first copy of a software package, video, or AI model exists, replicating it is basically free. Competitive forces, piracy, and open-source keep pushing selling prices toward that marginal cost, so the long-run price level for many goods is “free.”

When the price of digital goods aproches zero diffuse value capture becomes more effective than direct value capture. There are still incentives to produce the good if you have a diffuse net cast wide to capture value from adjacent products and services.

A fixed-supply digital asset like Bitcoin allows the economy to embrace tech-driven deflation instead of fighting it. As prices naturally fall to marginal cost, value doesn't disappear; it diffuses into cheaper goods, higher real wages, and shorter working hours. Any surplus productivity can accrue to holders of sound money rather than being siphoned off through money printing to finance debt.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.
