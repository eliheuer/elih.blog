# Diffuse Value Capture

<span class="text-muted-foreground">2025-04-28</span>

<p>“Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.”</p>

Imagine two people in an economy, Alice and Bob. They both work about 40 hours per week. Alice creates 10 units of value, but captures 9, almost all the value created. Bob creates 100 units of value, but only captures 10.

Alice captures 90% of the value created with 40 hours of work, while Bob captures 10% of the value created in the same amount of time, But Bob still captures more value than Alice.

I anciant times, before industrial production and IP-laws, there were different incentives. Just like industrial production saw a shift in how value was captured, I think we are seeing a shift back towards diffuse value capture as AI built on a remix paramige changes cultureal production.  

With recent advancements in AI and Crypto, I think we are seeing a shift in the way value is captured. A shift from dirrect to diffuse value capture.
