# Diffuse Value Capture

Thoughts on incentivizing post-authorship commons-based peer production with crypto and AI.

Published May 6th, 2025

<p>“Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.”</p>

<p>—Charlotte Fang, NFT's and Free Information, 2022.</p>

<p>“We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.”</p>

<p>—Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto, 1985.</p>

Imagine two people, Alice and Bob. They both work 40 hours per week at a similar task trying to capture value in various forms, like money and social capital. Alice creates 10 units of value, and captures 9, almost all the value. Bob creates 100 units of value, but only captures 10.

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10%, but Bob still captures slightly more value than Alice with the same amount of work. Alice and Bob are both working at different ends of a spectrum between diffuse and direct value capture.

Most IP law, corporate culture, and traditional finance asset formation is skewed towards the direct value capture end of the spectrum, but recent advancments in AI are starting to show the flaws in the direct value capture end of the spectrum. LLMs are diffuse in nature, direct value capture strageies don't map well onto them and direct value capture becomes a logistical nightmare.

Listen to conversations about AI and intelectual property and you will see there is very little consensuse on how to contine the current IP system in this new AI era. Too much dirrect value capture and the resulting complex licensing agreements will lead to the AI industry consolidating around a few large players, which will without a doubt devolve into rent-seeking stagnant monopolies.

For most of human history, value capture for cultural production was largely diffuse. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. They built on what came before without an arbitrary system of IP law.

Before the invention of the printing press, A poet would write a poem and share it with a small group of people. If someone liked it, they would share it with their friends and so on. A scribe would make a copy as a manuscript and sell it to someone else without permission of the author. This would help the scribe capture value from their craft and the poet would capture value in other ways such as patronage, teaching jobs, or talks and lectures.

The scribe copying the manuscript would help the poet because copying was so difficult, every new copy made would significantly increase the liklyhood of patronage, social capital, and other forms of value capture for the poet. The ideas and norms around intelectual property were directly influcenced by the current level to technology and automation for copying information.

Since the invention of the printing press, value capture for cultural production has mostly become more direct. Culminating in the pre-internet era of hollywood, the music industry, and publishing.

At the crest of this wave of direct value capture, the personal computer was developed, and planted the seeds for a cultural shift back towards diffuse value capture. Not as a return to the pre-industrial model of diffuse value capture, but as a new ways to capture value that are only possible with computers and decentralized networks.

Critics of capitalism often see direct value capture as inherant to capitalism, but I suspect it is more tied to the curent level of technology and automation, and today due to culture lagging behind technology. In a free market your margin is someone else's opportunity, and there is an endless supply of people that are willing to let some value go uncaptured in order to chanlange a stagnant incumbant in the market.

Remember culture lags behind technology, there was a 250 year gap between the invention of the printing press and what we now recognize as contemporary IP law and ideas about authorship and originality.

## The Hacker Ethic & Free Information

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The precepts of this revolutionary (early) Hacker Ethic were not so much debated and discusses as silently agreed upon. No manifestos were issused. No missionaries tried to gather converts. The computer did the converting.</p>

<p>—Steven Levy, Hackers, 1984.</p>
</div>

Much of the success of computing is due to the hacker ethic and the culture of sharing and remixing information. Like Steven Levy suggests, the technology of computing almost has this world view encoded in its architecture at the lowest level. The 0's and 1's are hard to own and copying is free. Forcing ideas around property from the physical world was never going to work.

Because of this, for most of recent history, programmers have seemed to live in the future. You could look at what programmers are doing and see a version of what other industries will look like in the future.

So it should not be a surprise that programming culture has understood diffuse value capture better than other industries in recent history.

There is currently a misalignment between value creation and value capture. Bill Gates networth is want time greater than Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, etc, and at least in my opnion, the later have provided significantly more value to computing. I think that Apple and Microft we never fully dirrupted by a Linux distribution is a sad state of afairs and that computer litteracy would be in a much beeter place is everyone was requiered to like the Unix CLI and tools like Vim and Git in elemnatry schhol. 

due to direct value capture. 

I don't think there needs to be laws or anything restricting dirrect value

Free and open-source software culture outside of crypto has been unable to develop effective value capture and coordination systems, and has largly been relegated to controled opposition and pawns in comoditize-your-compliment schemes. Despite anti-consumer behavior from big tech incumbants, free and open-source software mostly can't compete with proprietary alternative, whith some exceptions like Blender. But even Blender feels masivly under resourced for the amout of value it creates.

## Post-Authorship

The further you move in the direct value capture direction of the spectrum, the more you need to rely on your identity as a singular human to capture value. This is often at odds with how cultural production works in the real world.

In the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0, there was a lot of hype about commons-based peer production. The idea was that with the rise of the personal computer and the internet, we would see a new wave of cultural production that was not centered around the traditional gatekeeper model of hollywood and the music industry. Anyone online could colaborate with others to create new works of art.

GNU/Linux, free and open source software, Wikipedia, meme culture, and other examples of commons based peer production from the web 2.0 era.

Distributed authorship is the future because it’s a direct consequence of technological trends, as all culture follows from: increased dominance of decentralized content distribution networks over traditional media, massively accelerated ai content production built on a remix paradigm, hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online, all work to erode the artificial attempts to extend the pre-digital one-to-many media paradigm surviving now only through the dubiously defensible and ethically incoherent distortions of IP/copyright law pushed by legacy media company and the vague pseudomarxist anti-AI youth political movement, both against the heavier political weight of the tech industry; not to mention rising chinese soft power and global financial multipolarity. I’ve argued this is the future of culture for a decade because these trends were all obvious a decade ago and it’s now so obvious today it feels trite to repeat, yet here we are. This isn’t about political will or preferences; information “wants” to be free like water wants to flow down, it’s a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet—global networking, open content distribution, digital free association, runaway self-organizing culture—may slow it down, but it never succeed in stopping it in any timeline.



Trying to capture as much value as possible usually dosn't work well in the free market. An example I often use is that of font designers selling proprietary fonts with complicated and expensive licensing. This direct value capture strategy leads to extream belifes about authorship and originality, when in reality, the design of fonts is extremly memetic and every design is a remix of other designs. A truly unique font design that isn't built on a mountan of prior work and free and open-source software is almost impossible to find.

When direct value capture is your goal, your identity as a singualr human become extremly important. You are the center of the universe. You are the source of all value. You are the one who is entitled to capture the value created by others.

The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, marking it difficult to price, and easy to copy. Early attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

<p>1. Remixing is the natural mode of artmaking online; introducing any friction to process materials damages the sum art output of the community,</p>

<p>3. Art comes from the beyond & not in isolation; as the artist serves only as handmaiden to higher consciousnesses, it's hubris to be entitled to its bounties especially at the expense of its memetic fitness.</p>

<p>Accepting the death of authorship recognizes and rejects the social mores that hamper an ability to freely use, modify and propagate artist's work. However, it should be clear it's not necessarily a radical commitment to anti-authorship in all instances. It is true that artists imprint their personal interpretation of the divinity they channel (secular: zeitgeist, collective unconsciousness, so accreditation, especially in the context of canonization, is very often relevant, e.g. to trace a chronology of work to best understand it in reflection with an on-going practice.</p>

## Crypto World Computer

Technology is deflationary, as technology improves and allows us to do things better and faster with less work, the prices of goods and services should fall, but they don't for various reasons.



You could argue from an austrian economics perspective that the prices of goods and services should fall as technology improves, but they don't because of the way money is created and controlled. Simply moving to something like a global Bitcoin monetary standard might be a major component of a diffuse value capture system.

Due to the internect and the personal computer, cultural production has moved from a read-only medium to a read-write medium.

## Commons-Based Peer Production

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it.</p>

<p>—Karl Marx, Grundrisse, 1858.</p>
</div>

In the Grundrisse "Fragment on Machines," Marx imagines a moment when science, technique, and social cooperation are so deeply sedimented in machinery and communication networks that "general social knowledge"—what he calls the general intellect—becomes the decisive productive force. Value is now embodied less in any individual's labour-time and more in the collective intelligence crystallised in code, databases, and automated systems.

I naively thought the internet was supposed to be this amazing space where culture could flourish freely. Then it became a series of walled gardens. Big tech companies built fortresses around content. They became the gatekeepers, the toll collectors

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Their design assumes memes = an individual viral post, eg a specific funny tik tok, rather than call &amp; response remixed cultural virus, eg an evolving tik tok fad. Incredible millennial brainrot. They accidentally built a very poor, ultra thin prediction market on post engagement</p>&mdash; ♡ Charlotte Fang 🪲 Crown Prince ❀ LOVE HEALS 💞 (@CharlotteFang77) <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotteFang77/status/1913635465921700010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I naively still belive in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.

Remilia, like all true artists, is on a holy mission: our art's produced in lucid communion with the network, or the network's gods—and it wants propagation. No value opportunity is worth keeping it locked away, but really any work of interest trapped by their creators deserves liberation: guerilla acts of anti-authorship in the form of nonconsensual decreditation must be understood as a revolutionary praxis, freeing works from a creator's artificial shackles. Steal, remix, spread all real net art freely. All culture is permissionless.

We must do this, in order for AI to translate into more prosperity for all. It's skynet or utopia”
