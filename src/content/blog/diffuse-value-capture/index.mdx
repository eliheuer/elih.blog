# Diffuse Value Capture

Thoughts on incentivizing post-authorship commons-based peer production with crypto and AI.

<p>“Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.”</p>

<p>—Charlotte Fang, NFT's and Free Information, 2022.</p>

<p>“We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.”</p>

<p>—Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto, 1985.</p>

Imagine two people, Alice and Bob. They both work 40 hours per week at a similar task trying to capture value in various forms, like money and social capital. Alice creates 10 units of value, and captures 9, almost all value. Bob creates 100 units of value, but only captures 10.

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10%, but Bob still captures slightly more value than Alice with the same amount of work.


Bob is using a diffuse value capture strategy, and Alice is using a direct value capture strategy. This is a spectrum, and cultural production moves from one end to the other as technology and culture evolves. Culture often being the lagging variable influenced by technology.

For most of human history, value capture for cultural production was largely diffuse. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. They built on what came before without an arbitrary system of IP laws. Someone might tell a variation on a popular story around a camp fire just for social capital and the story would spread through the community unhindered by ideas of authorship and originality.

Before the invention of the printing press, A poet would write a manuscript and share it with a small group of people. If someone liked it, they would share it with their friends and so on. A scribe would make a copy of the and sell it to someone else without permission of the author. This would help the scribe capture value with their craft and the poet would capture value in other ways such as patronage or talks and lectures.

The scribe copying the manuscript would help the poet capture value because at the time making a copy was so difficult, that every new copy made would significantly increase the liklyhood of patronage and other forms of value capture for the poet.

Since the invention of the printing press, value capture for cultural production has mostly become more direct. Culminating in the pre-internet era of hollywood, the music industry, and publishing.

## The Hacker Ethic & Free Information

But with the invention of the computer and later the internet, blockchain, and LLMs, the technological seeds have been planted for a cultural shift back towards diffuse value capture. The hacker ethic of "share and remix" is being combined with the internet's ability to distribute information at near zero marginal cost.

This is not a retreat from capitalism to a pre-industrial model of value capture.

In the Grundrisse "Fragment on Machines," Marx imagines a moment when science, technique, and social cooperation are so deeply sedimented in machinery and communication networks that "general social knowledge"—what he calls the general intellect—becomes the decisive productive force. Value is now embodied less in any individual's labour‐time and more in the collective intelligence crystallised in code, databases, and automated systems.

## Post-Authorship

At the turn of the 21st century, the internet promised a permission‑free cultural commons in which anyone could publish, remix, and learn without gatekeepers, a move from a top down read-only medium to a bottom up read-write medium. Yet a quarter‑century later, we find ourselves navigating corporate walled gardens, paywalls, and digital‑rights‑management schemes that mimic the rivalrous constraints of physical goods. Meanwhile, artificial‑intelligence models ingest the entire corpus of human expression and remix it at super‑human speed, raising urgent questions about how creators will be rewarded when scarcity disappears.

The further you move in the direct value capture direction of the spectrum, the more you need to rely on your identity as a singular human to capture value. You are the center of the universe. You are the source of all value. You are the one who is entitled to capture the value created by others.

In the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0, there was a lot of hype about commons based peer production. The idea was that with the rise of the personal computer and the internet, we would see a new wave of cultural production that was not centered around the traditional gatekeeper model of hollywood and the music industry. Anyone online could colaborate with others to create new works of art.

GNU/Linux, free and open source software, Wikipedia, meme culture, and other examples of commons based peer production from the web 2.0 era.

Distributed authorship is the future because it’s a direct consequence of technological trends, as all culture follows from: increased dominance of decentralized content distribution networks over traditional media, massively accelerated ai content production built on a remix paradigm, hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online, all work to erode the artificial attempts to extend the pre-digital one-to-many media paradigm surviving now only through the dubiously defensible and ethically incoherent distortions of IP/copyright law pushed by legacy media company and the vague pseudomarxist anti-AI youth political movement, both against the heavier political weight of the tech industry; not to mention rising chinese soft power and global financial multipolarity. I’ve argued this is the future of culture for a decade because these trends were all obvious a decade ago and it’s now so obvious today it feels trite to repeat, yet here we are. This isn’t about political will or preferences; information “wants” to be free like water wants to flow down, it’s a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet—global networking, open content distribution, digital free association, runaway self-organizing culture—may slow it down, but it never succeed in stopping it in any timeline.



Trying to capture as much value as possible usually dosn't work well in the free market. An example I often use is that of font designers selling proprietary fonts with complicated and expensive licensing. This direct value capture strategy leads to extream belifes about authorship and originality, when in reality, the design of fonts is extremly memetic and every design is a remix of other designs. A truly unique font design that isn't built on a mountan of prior work and free and open-source software is almost impossible to find.

When direct value capture is your goal, your identity as a singualr human become extremly important. You are the center of the universe. You are the source of all value. You are the one who is entitled to capture the value created by others.

The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, marking it difficult to price, and easy to copy. Early attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

<p>Accepting the death of authorship recognizes and rejects the social mores that hamper an ability to freely use, modify and propagate artist's work. However, it should be clear it's not necessarily a radical commitment to anti-authorship in all instances. It is true that artists imprint their personal interpretation of the divinity they channel (secular: zeitgeist, collective unconsciousness, so accreditation, especially in the context of canonization, is very often relevant, e.g. to trace a chronology of work to best understand it in reflection with an on-going practice.</p>

## Crypto World Computer

Technology is deflationary, as technology improves and allows us to do things better and faster with less work, the prices of goods and services should fall, but they don't for various reasons.



You could argue from an austrian economics perspective that the prices of goods and services should fall as technology improves, but they don't because of the way money is created and controlled. Simply moving to something like a global Bitcoin monetary standard might be a major component of a diffuse value capture system.

Due to the internect and the personal computer, cultural production has moved from a read-only medium to a read-write medium.

## Commons-Based Peer Production

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it.</p>

<p>—Karl Marx, Grundrisse, 1858.</p>

I naively thought the internet was supposed to be this amazing space where culture could flourish freely. Then it became a series of walled gardens. Big tech companies built fortresses around content. They became the gatekeepers, the toll collectors

I naively still belive in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.

Remilia, like all true artists, is on a holy mission: our art's produced in lucid communion with the network, or the network's gods—and it wants propagation. No value opportunity is worth keeping it locked away, but really any work of interest trapped by their creators deserves liberation: guerilla acts of anti-authorship in the form of nonconsensual decreditation must be understood as a revolutionary praxis, freeing works from a creator's artificial shackles. Steal, remix, spread all real net art freely. All culture is permissionless.
