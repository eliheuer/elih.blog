# Diffuse Value Capture  

Published May 15th, 2025 (Draft)

## 1 Definitions

<span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">Diffuse:</span> Widely spread out rather than concentrated; dispersed across many points, participants, or locations.

<span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">Direct value capture:</span> many-to-one, closed, permissioned.

<span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">Diffuse value capture:</span> many-to-many, open, permissionless.

Direct and diffuse value capture exist on a spectrum; extremes on either end are rarely workable.

## 2 Thought Experiment

Alice and Bob both work 30 hours per week creating a similar digital good. They aim to capture value in various forms, such as money and social capital.

|                | Alice | Bob |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| Hours worked   | 30    | 30  |
| Value created  | 10    | 100 |
| Capture rate   | 90%   | 10% |
| Value captured | <span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 64)">9</span> | <span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">10</span> |

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10%, but Bob still captures slightly more value than Alice—one whole unit—with the same amount of work. This is effective diffuse value capture.

There is no upper limit to how much value one person can create. Producing 1,000 units and capturing just 1%, or producing 1,000,000 units and capturing 0.001%, can still yield meaningful returns.

## 3 Authorship & Originality

Authorship & Originality also exist on a diffuse-to-direct spectrum.

For most of human history, cultural production was diffuse. People wrote stories based on other stories, and sang songs based on other songs. Authorship and originality were diffuse.

Before the printing press, works often circulated anonymously or under the names of famous figures to lend prestige. Scribes copied manuscripts freely and without permission. Because duplication was so labor-intensive, limiting copying wasn’t a practical concern.

Ideas about authorship and intellectual property were shaped by the current level of technology for reproducing information.

Since the introduction of the printing press, Western cultural production has become increasingly direct, culminating in the pre-internet era of Hollywood, television, music, and publishing.

At the peak of this direct cultural wave, the personal computer emerged, initiating a shift back toward diffuse cultural production—not as a return to pre-industrial models, but as new models made possible by decentralized global computer networks.

There was a 250-year gap between the European printing press and the establishment of modern intellectual property law. While cultural timelines have accelerated, there remains a persistent lag between technological change and cultural adaptation.

| Year | Tech/Event | Immediate Reaction | Lasting Legal Shift |
|------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1040 | Bi Sheng (畢昇) invents movable-type printing in China | Modest adoption due to thousands of Chinese characters | Limited impact on Chinese legal frameworks for copying |
| 1450 | Gutenberg's movable-type printing press | Explosion of vernacular Bibles, pamphlets; authorities panic over heresy. | None yet, copying suddenly cheap, rules nonexistent. |
| 1476 | Caxton sets up England's first press | Crown issues ad-hoc printing patents, but enforcement is patchy. | Still no copyright—control via favors & guilds. |
| 1517 | Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses | Printed and distributed across Europe, sparks Reformation. | Demonstrates power of print to bypass traditional gatekeepers. |
| 1557 | Royal Charter for the Stationers' Company | Guild monopoly lets Crown censor by licensing printers. | Corporate control substitutes for author rights. |
| 1662 | Licensing of the Press Act | Censorship tightens; printers need a license or face seizure. | Parliament grows wary of monopoly but has no alternative. |
| 1695 | Licensing of the Press Act Lapses | 14-year vacuum—anyone may print; pamphlet culture booms. | Chaos forces lawmakers in Parliament to rethink “who owns a text”? |
| 1710 | Statute of Anne | For the first time, authors, not printers, receive a 14-year exclusive right. | The birth of modern copyright—arrives 250 yrs after the printing press. |
| 1910 | Qing Copyright Code | Short-lived but modeled on European statutes | Real enforcement waited until the PRC's 1990 law |

We are only at the dawn of the internet today.

## 4 Neo-China Arrives from the Future

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>“The seal stamps on old Chinese paintings are fundamentaly different from the signatures used in European paintings. Primarily they do not express authorship that might have authenticated the picture, therby making it unassailable. Instead, most seal stamps come from connoisseurs or collectors who inscribe themselves into the picture not only through their seal but also through their commentaries. Here art is a communicative, interactive practice that constantly changes even the artwork's appearance. Subsequent viewers of the picture take part in its creation.”</p>

<p>—Byung-Chul Han, [Shanzhai 山寨](https://youtu.be/hpADLkWvAHA), 2017.</p>
</div>

The diffuse-to-direct spectrum varies regionally. In the Far East, concepts of authorship and originality differ in ways that are not solely shaped by technology, but are deeply rooted in ancient Eastern religions and philosophies.

In Chinese thought, originality is not defined by a singular act of creation, but by an ongoing natural process—less about fixed identity, and more about continual transformation. Skillful reference signals depth of knowledge, and originality lies more in subtle recombination than in radical novelty.

In November 2023, DeepSeek-AI open-sourced its DeepSeek-LLM models, which already outperformed Meta’s Llama 2 on code and reasoning benchmarks. Fourteen months later, it unveiled DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter model that matched GPT-4 on key metrics. The company reported a final training cost of under $6 million—far less than what U.S. flagships spend. Today, a 100GB download and a few consumer-grade GPUs are enough to run and fine-tune a frontier-class model at home.

Western incumbents still cling to a direct value capture mindset—API call metering, closed-source weights, NDAs—while Chinese labs treat the model itself as a form of advertising for downstream services, hardware, and prestige. A thin proprietary layer provides just enough coordination to serve as trading alpha for their AI quant funds.

This is diffuse value capture in action, arriving just as American IP maximalists and AI safetyists lose the plot, scrambling to monopolize and control the AI industry.

Western critics often portray China’s loose stance on intellectual property as a drag on innovation, but in an AI-driven century, it may prove prescient. Is it possible the West took the wrong path—and that ancient Chinese views on authorship and originality, rooted in naturalistic processes and continual transformation, will more closely resemble the IP norms of the 21st century? Less like a God-like act of creation from a single source, and more like evolution itself.

The "Chinese century" might not be defined solely by GDP or rare-earth supply chains. It could be shaped by open-source abundance versus closed-source scarcity—by diffuse value capture rather than direct value capture.

Inside China, the leadership insists the country is on the road to communism. Marx’s concept of the general intellect can be seen as an early theory of diffuse value capture and artificial intelligence: collective knowledge, embedded in machines and networks, replacing individual labor as the primary source of wealth. Marx saw advanced, open capitalism as potentially closer to communism than the top-down control often associated with it in the West—he envisioned the withering away of the state, not its expansion.

Much of the Left’s failure since Marx can be traced to attempts to solve problems created by direct value capture using even more direct value capture—replacing markets with bureaucracy and coercion. In contrast, free-market capitalism at its most advanced begins to resemble utopian communism. They converge.

Open-source projects, public datasets, and shared model weights are literal instantiations of the Marx's concept of the general intellect. Innovation is cumulative and non-rivalrous; every fork or remix expands the commons rather than depleting it. Because value increasingly comes from shared pools of code and models, efforts at direct capture—exclusive IP, closed weights—create friction, while diffuse capture unleashes information flow and strengthens the network.

No totalitarian state is required to enforce direct or diffuse value capture. The free market will dynamically shift toward whichever form of value capture works best at any given moment and circumstance, given the current state of technology.

## 5 Neural Networks are Diffuse 

Contemporary culture, finance, and law are still skewed toward direct value capture—but recent advancements in AI are beginning to expose and intensify the longstanding flaws in this model. Neural networks are diffuse by nature; direct value capture does not map well onto them.

Art, music, code, design, and other cultural artifacts—culled from the open web—are diffused across latent space. Once creativity is encoded as a multi-trillion-parameter fog, the notion that you can meter each droplet of inspiration the way you once metered a DVD sale becomes economically and technically incoherent.

A neural network does not store information like a database storing rows. Any given weight is meaningless in isolation; value emerges only from the statistical interference of all weights acting in concert. Like pigments blended into paint, the original sources are no longer separable—you can’t point to a specific coordinate and say, “this vector belongs to that copyright holder.”

Listen to current conversations around AI and intellectual property and you’ll find little consensus on how to preserve the existing IP framework in this new era. Proposals for radical reform—once confined to the lunatic fringe—are now gaining traction in mainstream tech circles.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I agree</p>&mdash; gorklon rust (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1910840422789763511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The increasingly diffuse nature of cultural production—and the growing openness to new ways of thinking about intellectual property—is a direct consequence of technological trends:

1. The rise of decentralized networks over traditional media and finance.

2. Massively accelerated AI-driven content creation, built on a remix paradigm and inherently diffuse models.

3. Hyperfinancialization, which blurs the lines between leisure/consumption and labor/creation online.

This shift isn't driven by political will or personal preference. Information "wants" to be free, just as water wants to flow downhill—a constant, unidirectional force that doesn’t reverse with each barrier it breaches. Efforts to restrict the internet may delay its progress, but they never succeed in stopping it—not in any timeline.

## 6 The Hacker Ethic & Free Information

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The precepts of this revolutionary Hacker Ethic were not so much debated and discussed as silently agreed upon. No manifestos were issued. No missionaries tried to gather converts. The computer did the converting.</p>

<p>—Steven Levy, Hackers, 1984.</p>
</div>

Computers speak in copies, and the cost of duplication is effectively zero. When the medium itself is infinite replication, the default economic model can no longer be scarcity—it must be abundance and sharing.

The architecture of computing encodes this "hacker ethic" at its core, much like how neural networks are diffuse by nature.

Artificial scarcity imposed by legal means in the digital realm is an awkward simulacrum of real-world scarcity. Forcing physical-world notions of property onto information systems creates endless friction and runs counter to the grain of the medium. This primal, often unspoken orientation at the heart of computing is what Richard Stallman later formalized as software freedom.

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>“We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.”</p>

<p>—Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto, 1985.</p>
</div>

Free software—and its defanged offshoot, open source—has been at the core of computing culture ever since. As a result, programming culture has adapted to the shift toward diffuse value capture more readily than most other industries. In contrast, neighboring professions have struggled to move beyond the 20th-century mindset of direct value capture, along with its emphasis on authorship and originality.

Even within programming culture, there’s a gap between those who create value and those who capture it. Bill Gates’s fortune dwarfs that of Linus Torvalds or Richard Stallman, despite the latter having contributed significantly more to computing and the world at large. In Gates’s famous Letter to Hobbyists, software is treated as a naturally scarce product—no different from hardware. The diffuse nature of software and its unique economic properties never enter the picture.

Despite its massive success, free and open-source software culture still struggles to develop effective systems for value capture and coordination. In many domains, it remains a niche—often relegated to controlled opposition, hobby projects, unpaid or underpaid labor, résumé padding, or pawns in commoditize-your-complement strategies. The ecosystem continues to grapple with how to natively and diffusely capture value and coordinate production on its own terms.

Corporate patronage has been a primary driver of open-source development and one of the main ways value is captured from it. However, the direct value capture systems used by big tech often run counter to the diffuse nature of open-source.

Corporate patronage is inherently direct. It involves layers of bureaucracy and middlemen, with everything needing to be accounted for in ways legible to middle managers of middle managers. This creates blind-metric behavior, where open-source developers chase arbitrary KPIs rather than focusing on actual value creation. It slows down development and adds friction to the open, collaborative ethos of open-source.

Once an open-source developer becomes integrated into the direct value capture system of corporate patronage, they’re incentivized to gatekeep their work to preserve personal advantage. This reduces incentives to share knowledge, mentor others, or collaborate openly—all the properties that make open-source so powerful.

By contrast, diffuse value capture strategies align incentives with openness and collaboration. The more knowledge you share and the more you help grow the ecosystem around your project, the more value you can ultimately capture. While some degree of gatekeeping is necessary to protect community culture, the unproductive information asymmetry and cronyism produced by direct value capture systems are less financially incentivized in diffuse models.

With diffuse value capture the hacker ethic becomes fully aligned with financial incentives and competition at the highest levels of the market—where previously, it stood in tension with direct value capture.

The coordination mechanisms required to compete with companies like Apple and Nvidia as fully open-source organizations remain elusive. Still, the dream of "the year of the Linux desktop" refuses to die, and projects like Blender have managed to thrive—and nearly dominate their niche—despite chronic underfunding.

One notable exception is crypto. Open-source and diffuse by nature, it has created and captured a staggering amount of value. Yet it remains controversial and underutilized in many free and open-source software circles.

| 5 | Amazon | 2.2T | Technology |
| 6 | Bitcoin | 2.0T | Open-Source Commodity |
| 7 | Google | 1.9T | Technology |

It’s notable that Google—the company behind the “Attention Is All You Need” paper that helped ignite the current AI hype cycle—now has a market cap smaller than a decentralized, open-source project with an anonymous founder. Many of the failure modes of direct value capture are evident in Google, while cryptocurrencies are, surprisingly, defying many of the failure modes typically associated with diffuse value capture. What’s going on here?

## 7 Crypto & Diffuse Value Capture

Technology should be deflationary—every efficiency and automation ought to push prices down in a competitive free market. Yet almost all goods and services feel noticeably more expensive each year. Why is that?

In the United States, the broad money supply (M2) grew by roughly 40% between early 2020 and early 2025, masking the natural price reductions that technology and automation would otherwise deliver. To preserve purchasing power, simply saving in a hard-money asset—one with a fixed supply—like gold or Bitcoin offers a bureaucracy-free way to diffusely capture value from technological progress.

Gold’s main weakness as money is that it only solves scarcity—not speed or security in a digital world. It’s heavy to ship, difficult to divide finely, and costly to verify. As a result, people store it in banks and transact using paper or electronic claims instead. But that custody layer reintroduces the very counterparty risk, government control, and inflation-by-decree (via unbacked IOUs) that gold was meant to eliminate—while still exposing holders to confiscation and inflation via mining. A purely digital, finite asset like Bitcoin avoids all of these problems.

<Image

Like gold, Bitcoin has many advantages over real estate. Houses are non-fungible, non-transportable, non-divisible, and not instantly liquid. Ownership is taxed, maintenance is an ongoing cost, and there's always the risk of natural disasters or other catastrophes.

When single-family homes become a store of value, a monetary premium is added on top of their use value as shelter. People end up paying more than necessary just to secure basic housing.

Cheap housing is a form of diffuse value capture—it allows people to pursue activities with less direct value capture, such as maintaining independent open-source software or inventing new technologies without the burden of restrictive IP. We’ve seen this dynamic play out in cultural hubs like New York City and Berlin, where low-cost living initially enabled diffuse value capture in the form of art, music, and experimental technology. These activities made the cities more desirable, creating a positive feedback loop of diffuse value creation—until rising housing costs pushed out the very activities that made those places attractive, replacing them with direct value capture and eventually stifling innovation.

In these situations, many of the people investing in real estate are simply wealthy individuals seeking assets that preserve or grow their capital. But if Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer better long-term capital preservation than real estate, why not put that capital into crypto instead?

Doing so would be a boon for diffuse value capture—and for housing affordability, which remains a major quality-of-life issue for millions.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I&#39;m going to list this median house for 3x what the median family can afford.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/TCW9XeV8Q2">pic.twitter.com/TCW9XeV8Q2</a></p>&mdash; Darth Powell (@VladTheInflator) <a href="https://twitter.com/VladTheInflator/status/1912284080978423927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A slightly more advanced form of diffuse value capture than gold or real estate is the use of S&P 500 ETFs and the Boglehead investing strategy. These approaches allow individuals to capture value from the economy as a whole with minimal bureaucracy and few middlemen. Whatever value you create but fail to capture directly may be absorbed by companies like Google or Microsoft—and broad market exposure lets you reclaim a portion of it.

However, the S&P 500 faces a similar issue to real estate: it's increasingly used as a store of value and an inflation hedge, rather than for its original purpose—investing in innovative companies. As a result, equities can accrue a monetary premium beyond their speculative value, artificially inflating prices and distorting the market. This dynamic can make market data less meaningful and extend the lifespans of companies that have ceased to innovate, preserving stagnant bureaucracies long past their prime.

Is Apple in 2025—long after the era of Steve Jobs—still a strong speculative investment worthy of a $3.1 trillion market cap? How much of Apple’s valuation reflects genuine belief in its capacity to innovate, and how much is simply driven by ETFs parked in retirement accounts?

Wouldn’t we live in a healthier economic system if the stock market returned to being primarily a platform for speculative investments in innovative companies—instead of a repository for overgrown monopolies that have become too big to fail due to their role as passive stores of value?

| 3 | Apple | 3.1T | Technology |

The equity market presents numerous challenges to diffuse value capture. Many of the best investment opportunities—such as private equity and venture capital—are inaccessible to the average person. These markets are heavily gatekept: to participate, you must be an accredited investor, meet minimum income or net worth requirements, and afford high minimum investment thresholds. In practice, the public market often serves as a way for private equity to sell to the public after most of the returns have already been captured by wealthy insiders.

Even today, the average American can’t invest in most leading AI companies like OpenAI or Anthropic. Retail investors seeking AI exposure are pushed into proxies like NVIDIA—but buying NVIDIA stock is essentially a bet on its proprietary, direct value capture strategy, not on AI itself, which has the potential to unlock technologies capable of disrupting previously stable value capture moats like NVIDIA’s.

In the U.S., individuals are allowed to buy lottery tickets and gamble at casinos, yet are "protected" from accessing early-stage startup equity—supposedly for their own good. The traditional financial system is simply too closed, proprietary, and gatekept to enable diffuse value capture at the scale demanded by AI and other emerging technologies.

To me, it’s clear that global capitalism now requires open, fair, permissionless, and 24/7 financial infrastructure.

After Bitcoin’s success, many new blockchains emerged, featuring smart contracts and decentralized applications with the potential to replace the traditional financial system with open-source infrastructure—much like open-source software replaced proprietary software in the server-side battle in the 1990s.

These systems are open and diffuse by design. Just as computers are inherently aligned with free information and effortless copying, and neural networks are diffuse by nature. The diffuse-to-direct orientation of the upstream infrastructure often has downstream effects on how the technology is used, making programable blockchains like Ethereum more condusive to diffuse value capture.

If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum functions more like a public world computer. Ethereum lets anyone deploy a programmable token (an ERC-20 smart contract) that is immediately tradable on open, permissionless exchanges. Holders can pool two tokens in an automated market-maker like Uniswap, set (or accept) a swap fee, and earn a share of that fee for supplying liquidity—no bank or broker in the loop. The yield that banks normally pocket on deposits flows straight back to participants, a textbook case of diffuse value capture.

While finance is Ethereum’s most developed use case, its potential extends far beyond. As a general-purpose platform, Ethereum is also a fertile ground for cultural experimentation. One of the highest-market-cap tokens on the Ethereum blockchain isn’t tied to finance at all, but to internet culture: 0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933, $PEPE.

<Image

Pepe the Frog is a prime example of the shift from direct to diffuse culture. The character was created by Matt Furie in 2005 as part of his comic Boy’s Club. Pepe’s origin followed the traditional model of direct culture: a single creator with full control over the character and its world.

However, it’s worth noting that Matt Furie’s art style is a psychedelic blend of the media consumed by Gen X and elder millennials growing up in the 1980s that oftens dosn't try very hard to disgues it's influences. His work often evokes distorted echoes of pop culture icons—Jim Henson’s Muppets, Ronald McDonald, Skeletor, Freddy Krueger, Ninja Turtles, or Falkor from The NeverEnding Story—all diffused through Furie’s own surreal lens. In this way, he represents an interesting checkpoint in the transition from direct to diffuse culture.

This highlights a core tension in direct value capture systems: at some level, everything is a remix. Yet direct value capture requires a certain level of abstraction aways from source material to meet legal and social requirements for originality—asserting authorship and ownership over what is, in practice, always partially derived.

The Pepe the Frog character became an internet meme as his popularity steadily grew across platforms like Myspace, 4chan, and Tumblr starting in 2008. By 2015, he had become one of the most widely recognized memes on the internet. Pepe evolved in a decentralized, memetic fashion—without a central authority and entirely outside the intent of his original creator.

This culminated in Pepe becoming accociated with and widly used by various extreamist political groups, prompting Matt Furie to use his copyright in an attempt to stop the character’s use in this way. While Furie achieved some legal successes, the character ultimately had completlyescaped his control. Pepe took on drawing styles and lore with no single author, he just continued evolving online.

The nature of the internet made containment impossible. In an interview with Esquire, Furie said of Pepe’s use as a hate symbol: “It sucks, but I can't control it more than anyone can control frogs on the Internet.”

In late April 2023, during a crypto bear market following the collapse of FTX, a PEPE memecoin was launched on Ethereum and quickly reached a market cap of 1.6 billion by early May. Today, two years later, it has a market cap of 5.5 billion—down significantly from its all-time high of 11 billion in late 2024.

I was closely following the token at the time, and what I saw was a glimpse of crypto’s potential as a diffuse value capture system. The memecoin functioned as a minimal viable coordination and incentive mechanism layered on top of a diffuse cultural phenomenon. Suddenly, people were able to capture value from a meme in a way that had never been possible before.

The PEPE token revealed a new kind of economic logic: one where culture and capital could converge in real time, without formal structures, centralized leadership, or traditional IP enforcement. It was not a company, not a brand, not a product with a roadmap—but it generated billions in value simply by existing at the intersection of viral culture and programmable money. It marked a turning point: memetic energy could now be financialized at internet speed, and ownership could be shared, fluid, and anonymous.

Pepe layed the groundwork for a new generation of post-authorship projects—ones that didn’t just accidentally become diffuse internet memes, but were designed from the ground up to be that way. Projects like Milady, emerging from the alt-right Frog Twitter, embraced crypto-native tools to build aesthetic movements and social games with no clear origin, no central authority, and no copyright-safe backstory—only vibes, lore, and tokens. Where Pepe foreshadowed the loss of authorial control, Milady formalized it as a design principle.

## 8 Post-Authorship

The cultural obsession with authorship and originality that results from an over-reliance on direct value capture has become an weight dragging down creativity, collaboration, production incentives, and mental health.

We’ve built a world where value capture is tightly coupled to individual identity, and where success is measured by how effectively one can isolate, own, and defend ideas. This is not only at odds with how culture actually evolves—it actively suppresses the social and memetic nature of creative work.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Satie graphic is just the font Ogg Regular with the i changed to Ogg Regular Italic, plus a little bit of tracking...<a href="https://t.co/XtOXnRN6jE">https://t.co/XtOXnRN6jE</a> <a href="https://t.co/i59g2tbP5P">https://t.co/i59g2tbP5P</a></p>&mdash; Eli Heuer (@eliheuer) <a href="https://twitter.com/eliheuer/status/1730361630096306652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Increased importance of identity politics, specifically in universities and professional circles between the 2010s and 2020s has exacerbated the tendancy of dirrect value capture systems to over focus on identity and authorship. This has led to a lot of disfunction in most professional feilds where identity and personal brand are more important than actual work or productive outcomes.

Near height of this increasingly disfunctional trend, the NFT PFP Milady was launched on Ethereum.

Trying to capture as much value as possible usually doesn't work well in the free market. An example I often use is that of font designers selling proprietary fonts with complicated and expensive licensing. This direct value capture strategy leads to extreme beliefs about authorship and originality, when in reality, the design of fonts is extremely memetic and every design is a remix of other designs. A truly unique font design that isn't built on a mountain of prior work and free and open-source software is almost impossible to find.



The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, making it difficult to price, and easy to copy. Early attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

Distributed authorship is the future because it's a direct consequence of technological trends, as all culture follows from: increased dominance of decentralized content distribution networks over traditional media, massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm, hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online, all work to erode the artificial attempts to extend the pre-digital one-to-many media paradigm surviving now only through the dubiously defensible and ethically incoherent distortions of IP/copyright law pushed by legacy media companies and the vague pseudomarxist anti-AI youth political movement, both against the heavier political weight of the tech industry; not to mention rising Chinese soft power and global financial multipolarity. I've argued this is the future of culture for a decade because these trends were all obvious a decade ago and it's now so obvious today it feels trite to repeat, yet here we are. This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet—global networking, open content distribution, digital free association, runaway self-organizing culture—may slow it down, but it never succeeds in stopping it in any timeline.

## 9 Incentivizing post-authorship commons-based peer production.

In the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0, there was a lot of hype about commons-based peer production. The idea was that with the rise of the personal computer and the internet, we would see a new wave of cultural production that was not centered around the traditional gatekeeper model of hollywood and the music industry. Anyone online could colaborate with others to create new works of art.


AI, blockchain, and post-authorship diffuse culture are converging, and I believe we will see a super charged new wave of commons based peer production as a result.

Working for your bags.

I naively still believe in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

In digital markets the marginal(additional) cost of producing the next unit often approaches zero. Once the first copy of a software package, video, or AI model exists, replicating it is basically free. Competitive forces, piracy, and open-source keep pushing selling prices toward that marginal cost, so the long-run price level for many goods is “free.”

When the price of digital goods aproches zero diffuse value capture becomes more effective than direct value capture. There are still incentives to produce the good if you have a diffuse net cast wide to capture value from adjacent products and services.

A fixed-supply digital asset like Bitcoin allows the economy to embrace tech-driven deflation instead of fighting it. As prices naturally fall to marginal cost, value doesn't disappear; it diffuses into cheaper goods, higher real wages, and shorter working hours. Any surplus productivity can accrue to holders of sound money rather than being siphoned off through money printing to finance debt.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.
