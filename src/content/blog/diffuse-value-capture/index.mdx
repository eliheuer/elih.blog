# Diffuse Value Capture  

Incentivising post-authorship commons-based peer production.

Published May 8th, 2025

<p>“Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.”</p>

<p>“We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.”</p>

## 1 Definitions

Direct value capture—one-to-many, closed, zero-sum, terminal.

Diffuse value capture—many-to-many, open, positive-sum, recursive.

Direct and diffuse value capture exist on a spectrum, extreams on both ends are almost always unworkable.

The direct end has: bureaucracy, gatekeeping, permissions, managerial overhead, funding politics, user hostile licensing, and complex IP law.

The diffuse end has: disorganazation, coordination failure, infighting, extreamist politics, burnout, and a lack of incentives.

## 2 Thought Experiment

Imagine two people, Alice and Bob. They both work 30 hours per week at a similar task creating some kind of digital good. They are trying to capture value from this activity in various forms like money and/or social capital.

{/*
Alice and Bob each have different strategies for distribution, intellectual property licensing, and production, as well as different cultural views around originality and authorship in their craft. 
*/}

|                | Alice | Bob |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| Hours worked   | 30    | 30  |
| Value created  | 10    | 100 |
| Capture rate   | 90%   | 10% |
| Value captured | <span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 64)">9</span> | <span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">10</span> |

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10%, but Bob still captures slightly more value than Alice—one whole unit—with the same amount of work. This is effective diffuse value capture.

There is no upperbound to the amount of value one person can create, so creating 1000 units and captureing 1% would also work, creating 1000000 units and captuing 0.001% would be even better.

## 3 Authorship & Originality Exist on a Diffuse-to-Direct Spectrum

For most of human history, cultural production was largely diffuse. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. Authorship and originality were diffuse, and in many cultures, divine in origin.

Before the invention of the printing press, a poet would write a poem and share it with people. If someone liked it, they would share it with other people. A scribe would make a copy as a manuscript and sell it without permission of the author. This would help the scribe capture value from their craft and the poet would capture value in other ways such as patronage, teaching jobs, or talks and lectures.

The scribe copying the manuscript would help the poet because copying was so difficult and time consuming that every new copy made would significantly increase the likelihood of patronage for the poet. The culture of intellectual property was directly influenced by the current level of technology for copying information.

Since the invention of the printing press, cultural production has mostly become more direct. Culminating in the pre-internet era of Hollywood, TV, the music industry, and publishing. 

At the crest of this wave of direct culture, the personal computer was developed, and planted the seeds for a shift back towards diffuse culture. Not as a return to the pre-industrial models, but new models that are only possible with decentralized global many-to-many computer networks.


Remember that culture lags behind technology, there was a 250 year gap between the invention of the printing press and what we now recognize as contemporary IP law and ideas about authorship and originality. So while timelines for cultural shifts are getting shorter, there is still a lag between the technology and the culture.

| Year | Tech/Event | Immediate Reaction | Lasting Legal Shift |
|------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1450 | Gutenberg's movable-type printing press | Explosion of vernacular Bibles, pamphlets; authorities panic over heresy. | None yet, copying suddenly cheap, rules nonexistent. |
| 1476 | Caxton sets up England's first press | Crown issues ad-hoc printing patents, but enforcement is patchy. | Still no copyright—control via favors & guilds. |
| 1517 | Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses | Printed and distributed across Europe, sparks Reformation. | Demonstrates power of print to bypass traditional gatekeepers. |
| 1557 | Royal Charter for the Stationers' Company | Guild monopoly lets Crown censor by licensing printers. | Corporate control substitutes for author rights. |
| 1662 | Licensing of the Press Act | Censorship tightens; printers need a license or face seizure. | Parliament grows wary of monopoly but has no alternative. |
| 1695 | Licensing of the Press Act Lapses | 14-year vacuum—anyone may print; pamphlet culture booms. | Chaos forces lawmakers in Parliament to rethink “who owns a text”? |
| 1710 | Statute of Anne | For the first time, authors, not printers, receive a 14-year exclusive right. | The birth of modern copyright—arrives 250 yrs after the printing press. |

We are only just at the dawn of the transition from [TV to the Internet](https://youtu.be/-BOeTJz-Eag), and the cultural lag behind technology is still significant.

{/*
Critics of capitalism often see one-to-many direct culture as inherent to capitalism, and many-to-many diffuse culture as the counter to the capitalist spirit, but I suspect capitalism's prefrance for direct or diffuse culture is more tied to the current level of technology and automation, and today due to the aforementioned cultural lag behind technology. In a free market your margin is someone else's opportunity, and in the absense of govenment intervention there is an endless supply of people that are willing to let some value go uncaptured in order to challenge a stagnant incumbent in the market.

Things like S&P 500 ETFs and the Boglehead investing strategy can be seen as primitive forms of diffuse value capture fully aligned with mainstream capitalism. It's a way to diffusely capture value from the economy in aggregate with minimal bureaucracy and middlemen, whatever value you create but fail to capture, you can get some of it back through a broad market index. 
*/}

{/*
Marx himself I think saw the potential for diffuse value capture in advanced capitalism. Much of the failures of the Left since then can be seen as a result of the tyranny and bureaucracy required by trying to solve the problems created by direct value capture with more direct value capture and transfer.

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it.</p>

<p>—Karl Marx, Grundrisse, 1858.</p>
</div>

In the Grundrisse "Fragment on Machines," Marx imagines a moment when science, technique, and social cooperation are so deeply sedimented in machinery and communication networks that "general social knowledge"—what he calls the general intellect—becomes the decisive productive force. Value is now embodied less in any individual's labour-time and more in the collective intelligence crystallised in code, databases, and automated systems. It's hard not to see this as a description of the current state of the internet and AI.

## 4 Neural Networks are Diffuse 

Contemporary culture, finance, and law are skewed towards direct value capture, but recent advancements in AI are starting to exacerbate longstanding flaws in this orientation. Neural networks are diffuse in nature, direct value capture does not map well onto them.

Art, music, code, design, and other cultural products, culled from the open web, are diffused across latent space. Once creativity is encoded as a multi-trillion-parameter fog, the idea that you can meter each droplet of inspiration the way you meter a DVD sale becomes economically and technically incoherent. Latent diffusion turns this into a phase-change problem: solids (individual works) melt into air (weight vectors).

Listen to conversations about AI and intellectual property and you will see there is very little consensus on how to continue the current IP system in this new AI era. Calls for radical reforms that used to be relegated to the lunatic fringe are gaining traction in mainstream tech circles.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I agree</p>&mdash; gorklon rust (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1910840422789763511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A trend toward diffuse cultural production is a direct consequence of technological trends:

1. Increased dominance of decentralized networks over traditional media and finance. 

2. Massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm and inherently diffuse AI models.

3. Hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online.
 
This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet may slow it down, but never succeed in stopping it in any timeline.

## 5 The Hacker Ethic & Free Information

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The precepts of this revolutionary (early) Hacker Ethic were not so much debated and discussed as silently agreed upon. No manifestos were issued. No missionaries tried to gather converts. The computer did the converting.</p>

<p>—Steven Levy, Hackers, 1984.</p>
</div>

 Whatever the hacker ethic is, the technology of computing has this imperative encoded in its architecture at the lowest level. 0's and 1's are hard to own and copying is free. Artificial scarcity created by legal means in the digital realm is an awkward simulacrum of real world scarcity. Forcing ideas around property from the physical world was never going to work. 

Programming culture has understood and adapted to diffuse value capture better than other industries in recent history. While other similar and adjacent professions have struggled to escape the 20th century mindset of direct value capture, and the emphisis on authorship and originality that comes with it.

Even among programmers, there is a misalignment between value creation and value capture. Bill Gates net worth is many times greater than Linus Torvalds or Richard Stallman. etc, and at least in my opinion, the latter have provided significantly more value to computing and the world. They created 1000000000 units of value, but only captured 1.

Free and open-source software culture outside of crypto has been unable to develop effective value capture and coordination systems, and has largely been relegated to controlled opposition, free/cheap labor, Resume slop to get jobs, and pawns in commoditize-your-complement schemes.

  alt="A meme about open source without diffuse value capture"

Despite anti-consumer behavior from big tech incumbents, free and open-source software mostly can't compete with proprietary alternatives. The incentives and coordination mechanisms are missing.

## 6 Crypto & Diffuse Value Capture

Technology is deflationary, as technology improves and allows us to do things better and faster with less work, the prices of goods and services should fall, but they don't for various reasons.

Pepe the Frog is a prime example of the shift from direct to diffuse culture, and will without a doubt be studied in art history books for centuries to come.

You could argue from an austrian economics perspective that the prices of goods and services should fall as technology improves, but they don't because of the way money is created and controlled. Simply moving to something like a global Bitcoin monetary standard might be a major component of a diffuse value capture system.

Due to the internet and the personal computer, cultural production has moved from a read-only medium to a read-write medium.


## 7 Post-Authorship

The further you move in the direct value capture direction of the spectrum, the more you need to rely on your identity as a singular human to capture value. This is often at odds with how cultural production works in the real world.

In the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0, there was a lot of hype about commons-based peer production. The idea was that with the rise of the personal computer and the internet, we would see a new wave of cultural production that was not centered around the traditional gatekeeper model of hollywood and the music industry. Anyone online could colaborate with others to create new works of art.

When direct value capture is your goal, your identity as a singular human becomes extremely important. You are the center of the universe. You are the source of all value. You are the one who is entitled to capture the value created by others.

<p>1. Remixing is the natural mode of artmaking online; introducing any friction to process materials damages the sum art output of the community,</p>

<p>Accepting the death of authorship recognizes and rejects the social mores that hamper an ability to freely use, modify and propagate artist's work. However, it should be clear it's not necessarily a radical commitment to anti-authorship in all instances. It is true that artists imprint their personal interpretation of the divinity they channel (secular: zeitgeist, collective unconsciousness, so accreditation, especially in the context of canonization, is very often relevant, e.g. to trace a chronology of work to best understand it in reflection with an on-going practice.</p>

</div>

Trying to capture as much value as possible usually doesn't work well in the free market. An example I often use is that of font designers selling proprietary fonts with complicated and expensive licensing. This direct value capture strategy leads to extreme beliefs about authorship and originality, when in reality, the design of fonts is extremely memetic and every design is a remix of other designs. A truly unique font design that isn't built on a mountain of prior work and free and open-source software is almost impossible to find.



The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, making it difficult to price, and easy to copy. Early attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

Distributed authorship is the future because it's a direct consequence of technological trends, as all culture follows from: increased dominance of decentralized content distribution networks over traditional media, massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm, hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online, all work to erode the artificial attempts to extend the pre-digital one-to-many media paradigm surviving now only through the dubiously defensible and ethically incoherent distortions of IP/copyright law pushed by legacy media companies and the vague pseudomarxist anti-AI youth political movement, both against the heavier political weight of the tech industry; not to mention rising Chinese soft power and global financial multipolarity. I've argued this is the future of culture for a decade because these trends were all obvious a decade ago and it's now so obvious today it feels trite to repeat, yet here we are. This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet—global networking, open content distribution, digital free association, runaway self-organizing culture—may slow it down, but it never succeeds in stopping it in any timeline.

## 8 Incentivizing post-authorship commons-based peer production.

Working for your bags.

I naively still believe in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.
