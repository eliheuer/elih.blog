# Diffuse Value Capture

<p>Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just as double book accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical aberration.</p>

The Internet promised a permission‑free cultural commons in which anyone could publish, remix, and learn without gatekeepers. Yet a quarter‑century later, we find ourselves navigating corporate walled gardens, paywalls, and digital‑rights‑management schemes that mimic the rivalrous constraints of physical goods. Meanwhile, artificial‑intelligence models ingest the entire corpus of human expression and remix it at super‑human speed, raising urgent questions about how creators will be rewarded when scarcity disappears.

This essay proposes diffuse value capture: a design space of mechanisms that reward contributors to the commons without imposing artificial scarcity. The goal is to realign incentives so that value flows proportionally to those who create it—even when their work is freely shared, forked, and remixed.

Imagine two people, Alice and Bob. They both work 40 hours per week. Alice creates 10 units of value, and captures 9, almost all the value created. Bob creates 100 units of value, but only captures 10.

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10% with the same amount of of, but Bob still captures more value than Alice.

The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, leaving it impossible to price, free like air. Primitive attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

Digital scarcity instituted by legal infrastructure was an awkward, artificial and ethically problematic intervention on the free flow of information; NFTs managing scarcity as a trustless bookkeeping allows accessibility to be achieved without undermining production incentives.

Technology is deflationary, as technology improves and allows us to do things better and faster with less work, the prices of goods and services should fall, but they don't for various reasons.

You could argue from an austrian economics perspective that the prices of goods and services should fall as technology improves, but they don't because of the way money is created and controlled. Simply moving to something like a global Bitcoin monetary standard might be a major component of a diffuse value capture system.


Due to the internect and the personal computer, cultural production has moved from a read-only medium to a read-write medium.

Our culture is becoming a remix culture again. For most of human history. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. They built on what came before without an arbitrary system of IP laws.

I naively thought the internet was supposed to be this amazing space where culture could flourish freely. Then it became a series of walled gardens. Big tech companies built fortresses around content. They became the gatekeepers, the toll collectors

I naively still belive in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.
