## 1 Definitions

Direct value capture—many-to-one, closed, permissioned.

Diffuse value capture—many-to-many, open, permissionless.

Direct and diffuse value capture exist on a spectrum, extremes on both ends are almost always unworkable.

{/*
Direct end failure modes: bureaucracy, gatekeeping, permissions, managerial overhead, funding politics, metrics fixation, user hostile licensing, and complex IP law.

Diffuse end failure modes: disorganization, coordination failure, infighting, extremist politics, burnout, and a lack of incentives.

## 2 Thought Experiment
{/*
Imagine two people, Alice and Bob. They both work 30 hours per week at a similar task creating some kind of digital good. They are trying to capture value from this activity in various forms like money and/or social capital.

Alice and Bob both work 30 hours per week creating a similar digital good. They are trying to capture value in various forms like money and/or social capital.

|                | Alice | Bob |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| Hours worked   | 30    | 30  |
| Value created  | 10    | 100 |
| Capture rate   | 90%   | 10% |
| Value captured | <span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 64)">9</span> | <span style="color:rgb(24, 234, 101)">10</span> |

Alice captures 90% of the value created, and Bob captures 10%, but Bob still captures slightly more value than Alice—one whole unit—with the same amount of work. This is effective diffuse value capture.

There is no upper bound to the amount of value one person can create, so creating 1000 units and captureing 1%, or creating 1000000 units and captureing 0.001% would also work.

## 3 Authorship & Originality Also Exist on a Diffuse-to-Direct Spectrum

For most of human history, cultural production was diffuse. People wrote stories based on other stories. They sang songs that were variations of other songs. Authorship and originality were diffuse.

{/*
Before the printing press, a scribe copying a manuscript would help the author because copying was so difficult and time consuming that every new copy made would significantly increase the likelihood of patronage. The culture of intellectual property was directly influenced by the current level of technology for copying information. Most works circulated anonymously or under famous names to lend prestige.

Before the printing press, many works circulated anonymously or under famous names to lend prestige. Scribes duplicated manuscripts without permission. Copying was so difficult and time consuming that limiting copying was not a problem. The culture of intellectual property was directly influenced by the current level of technology for copying information.

After the printing press was introduced to Europe, western cultural production has mostly become more direct as a result. Culminating in the pre-internet era of Hollywood, TV, the music industry, and publishing.

At the crest of this wave of direct culture, the personal computer was developed, and started a shift back towards diffuse culture. Not as a return to the pre-industrial models, but as new models that are only possible with decentralized global computer networks.

There was a 250 year gap between the European printing press and what we now recognize as contemporary IP law. So while timelines for cultural shifts are getting shorter, there is still a lag between technology and culture.

| Year | Tech/Event | Immediate Reaction | Lasting Legal Shift |
|------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1040 | Bi Sheng (畢昇) invents movable-type printing in China | Modest adoption due to thousands of Chinese characters | Limited impact on Chinese legal frameworks for copying |
| 1450 | Gutenberg's movable-type printing press | Explosion of vernacular Bibles, pamphlets; authorities panic over heresy. | None yet, copying suddenly cheap, rules nonexistent. |
| 1476 | Caxton sets up England's first press | Crown issues ad-hoc printing patents, but enforcement is patchy. | Still no copyright—control via favors & guilds. |
| 1517 | Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses | Printed and distributed across Europe, sparks Reformation. | Demonstrates power of print to bypass traditional gatekeepers. |
| 1557 | Royal Charter for the Stationers' Company | Guild monopoly lets Crown censor by licensing printers. | Corporate control substitutes for author rights. |
| 1662 | Licensing of the Press Act | Censorship tightens; printers need a license or face seizure. | Parliament grows wary of monopoly but has no alternative. |
| 1695 | Licensing of the Press Act Lapses | 14-year vacuum—anyone may print; pamphlet culture booms. | Chaos forces lawmakers in Parliament to rethink “who owns a text”? |
| 1710 | Statute of Anne | For the first time, authors, not printers, receive a 14-year exclusive right. | The birth of modern copyright—arrives 250 yrs after the printing press. |
| 1910 | Qing Copyright Code | Short-lived but modeled on European statutes | Real enforcement waited until the PRC's 1990 law |


We are only at the dawn of the internet today.

## 4 Neo-China Arrives from the Future

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>“The seal stamps on old Chinese paintings are fundamentaly different from the signatures used in European paintings. Primarily they do not express authorship that might have authenticated the picture, therby making it unassailable. Instead, most seal stamps come from connoisseurs or collectors who inscribe themselves into the picture not only through their seal but also through their commentaries. Here art is a communicative, interactive practice that constantly changes even the artwork's appearance. Subsequent viewers of the picture take part in its creation.”</p>

<p>—Byung-Chul Han, [Shanzhai 山寨](https://youtu.be/hpADLkWvAHA), 2017.</p>
</div>

The diffuse-to-direct spectrum shifts regionally. The Far East has different views on authorship and originality that are not purely due to available technology and are rooted in ancient eastern religions and philosophies.

The Chinese idea of the original is less determined by a unique act of creation, but by a natural unending process, not by definitive identity but by constant change. Skillful reference signals erudition; originality in nuanced re-combination, not radical newness.

In late 2024 DeepSeek-AI quietly open-sourced DeepSeek LLM, trained from scratch on a 2-trillion-token bilingual corpus and already edging past Llama 2 on code and reasoning tasks.
 
By early 2025 it followed with DeepSeek R1/R2, a 671-billion-parameter mixture-of-experts model that reaches GPT-4-class performance with a training budget of roughly $5-6 million—two orders of magnitude below U.S. flagships. 
The cost to copy a frontier model has collapsed to the price of downloading 100 GB, and every copy invites further improvement.

Western incumbents still cling to a direct value capture mindset—API call metering, secret weights, NDAs—while Chinese labs treat the model itself as advertising for downstream services, hardware, and prestige. Plus a thin layer of proprietary coordination that serves as alpha for their AI quant funds.

This is diffuse capture in action. It channels centuries of permissive reuse ethos into the hottest technology in the world—and it arrives just as American IP maximalists and AI safetyists lose the plot trying to monopolize and control the AI industry.

Western observers often see the Chinese approch to intelectual property as a hindrance to the Chinese economy and behind the West, but it might be the right approach in a century defined by AI and open-source software. Is it possible the West took the wrong path and anciant Chinese views on authorship and originality will be closer to what IP culture becomes in the distant future, more coslely resembling a naturalistic process of evolution than a God-like act of creation from a single source.

The "Chinese century" might not just be about GDP or rare-earth supply chains. It could be open-source abundance defeating closed-source scarcity.

{/*
Chinese communism is remarkably open to transformation compared to westen communism which has been much more resistant to change and adaptation. This can be seen as a result of differing attitudes to origionality, an authorship obsessed culture is much more likley to get stuck blindly following a dead thinker or clinging to an ideology past its moment of usfulness, and refusing adaptation as heresy.

Marx’s “general intellect” is essentially an early theory of diffuse value capture and AI: collective knowledge, embedded in machines and networks, replacing individual labour as the chief source of wealth. He saw advanced free and open capitalism as closer to communism than the top down control we think of as communism in the west (withering away of the state). Much of the failures of the Left since Marx can be seen as a result of the tyranny and bureaucracy required by trying to solve the problems created by direct value capture with more direct value capture.

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The development of fixed capital(machines, software, AI, etc) indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it.</p>

It's hard not to see this as a description of the current state of AI.

## 5 Neural Networks are Diffuse 

Contemporary culture, finance, and law are skewed towards direct value capture, but recent advancements in AI are starting to exacerbate longstanding flaws in this orientation. Neural networks are diffuse in nature, direct value capture does not map well onto them.

Art, music, code, design, and other cultural products, culled from the open web, are diffused across latent space. Once creativity is encoded as a multi-trillion-parameter fog, the idea that you can meter each droplet of inspiration the way you meter a DVD sale becomes economically and technically incoherent.

A neural network does not store information from its training set the way a database stores rows. Any given weight is meaningless in isolation; value only emerges from statistical interference among all the weights at once. Like pigments mixed into paint, the underlying sources are no longer separable, you cannot point to a specific coordinate and say this vector belongs to Stephen Wolfram.

Listen to conversations about AI and intellectual property and you will see there is very little consensus on how to continue the current IP system in this new AI era. Calls for radical reforms that used to be relegated to the lunatic fringe are gaining traction in mainstream tech circles.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I agree</p>&mdash; gorklon rust (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1910840422789763511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The increasingly diffuse nature of cultural production and openness to new way of thinking about IP is a direct consequence of technological trends:

1. Increased dominance of decentralized networks over traditional media and finance. 

2. Massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm and inherently diffuse AI models.

3. Hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online.
 
This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet may slow it down, but never succeed in stopping it in any timeline.

## 6 The Hacker Ethic & Free Information

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>The precepts of this revolutionary (early) Hacker Ethic were not so much debated and discussed as silently agreed upon. No manifestos were issued. No missionaries tried to gather converts. The computer did the converting.</p>

<p>—Steven Levy, Hackers, 1984.</p>
</div>

Computers speak in copies and duplication costs effectively zero. When the medium itself is infinite replication, the default economic model can no longer be scarcity; it must be abundance and sharing.

The technology of computing has this "hacker ethic" imperative encoded in its architecture at the lowest level. Artificial scarcity created by legal means in the digital realm is an awkward simulacrum of real world scarcity. Forcing ideas around property from the physical world poses endless challenges. This primal instinct at the core of computing is what Richard Stallman later formalised as software freedom, due to his experiances at the MIT AI lab.

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">
<p>“We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.”</p>

<p>—Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto, 1985.</p>
</div>

Free software and its de-fanged off-shoot open-source have been at the core of comptuing culture ever since, it's imposible to seriously use a computer without encountering it. As a result, programming culture has understood and adapted to shifts towards diffuse value capture better than other industries in recent history. While other similar and adjacent professions have struggled to escape the 20th century mindset of direct value capture, and the emphisis on authorship and originality that comes with it.

Even among programmers, there is a misalignment between value creation and value capture. Bill Gates net worth is many times greater than Linus Torvalds or Richard Stallman. etc, and at least in my opinion, the latter have provided significantly more value to computing and the world. The incentives for direct value capture are still very strong, In Bill Gates famous letter to hobbist the idea of more defuse value capture strategies dosn't even accure to him. To him at that time, there was no difference bettwen selling natrually scarse hardware and and artificially scarse software.

I can't blame him and I understand his perspecive, even today free and open-source software culture has struggled to develop effective value capture and coordination systems. While on one hand it has been an unbelable susess that undeniably changed the world forever, in many domains it is still a niche and has largely been relegated to controlled opposition, free/cheap labor, Resume slop to get jobs, and pawns in commoditize-your-complement schemes. Diffuse culture still lacks effective diffuse value capture systems.

The incentives and coordination mechanisms requered to compete with the Apples and Nvidias of the world seem to be are missing. One exception being cyrpto curancies, which are open-source and diffuse by nature, but remain controvercial in many free and open-source circles.

| Rank | Asset | Market Cap | Type |

It is notable that at the height of the current AI hype cycle, Google, the companie that facilitated the attention is all you need paper that kickstarted the AI hype cycle, Has a market cap smaller than an open-source decentralized currency with an anonymous founder. Every failure mode of direct value capture is on full display at Google, and cryptocurrancies are defying many of the failure modes of diffuse value capture. What is going on here.

## 7 Crypto & Diffuse Value Capture

<div class="pl-6 my-8 [&>*]:text-muted-foreground">

Technology should be deflationary: every efficiency and automation ought to push prices down in a compedative free market. Yet almost all goods and services feel noticeably pricier each year. Why is this.

In the United States, broad money supply (M2) grew roughly 40% between early 2020 and early 2025. Looking at the Fed's M2 money-supply data, the money stock rose from about 15.4 trillion in January 2020 to more than 21.5 trillion by early 2025.

More dollars chasing the same goods props prices up, masking the natural price-cuts technology and automation would deliver. Simply saving in a hard money (limited supply) asset like gold or Bitcoin is a simple bureaucracy free way to capture value diffusly from technology and automation.

Gold's main weakness as money is that it only solves scarcity—not speed or security in a digital world: it's heavy to ship, hard to divide finely, and expensive to verify, so people end up storing it in banks and using paper or electronic claims instead. That custody layer re-introduces the very counter-party risk, government control, and inflation-by-decree (through unbacked IOUs) that gold was meant to avoid, while still leaving holders exposed to confiscation and mining-driven supply growth—all problems a purely digital bearer asset like Bitcoin sidesteps.

<Image 
  src={Gold} 
  alt="Gold" 
  width={1200}

  class="rounded-md"
/>

Bitcoin keeps the good parts of gold—limited supply and no reliance on a government—but removes the hassles. Its cap of 21 million coins means it can never be “mined” in unlimited amounts the way new gold gets dug up each year. You can verify, store, and move Bitcoin with a phone or computer instead of vaults, trucks, or border inspections, and you can divide it down to a hundred-millionth of a coin to pay for small things. Because it's scarcer, easier to send, and harder to seize than gold, Bitcoin is in many ways a better store of value for a digital, global economy.

Besides Gold and incresinglingly Bitcoin and other cryptos, Real Estate is another long term capital preservation strategy. When single family homes become a store of value, a monetary premium is added on top of their use value as a place to live. Houses are also non fungible, non transportable, and non divisible, and not instatly liquid, ownership is taxed, and there is constant maintenance and upkeep, plus risk of natural disasters and other catastrophes.

When housing has a monetary premium, people spend more money than necicary on housing. Cheap housing is a method of diffuse value capture, it allows people to persure activities that don't involve too much direct value capture, and they diffusly capture value via affordable housing. This dynamic is what we have seen in major culture industry centers line NYC and Berlin, low-cost living allows for more diffuse value capture activites like art, music, and experimental tech, these activites diffuse into these cities making them more disierable to live in. This creates a positive feedback loop of diifuse value capture that lasts until housing becomes too expensive and all the diffuse value capture activites are replace with dirrect value capture activites, eventually squelching the things that made that area desirable in the first place.

Many people involved with Real Estate in these situation are simply wealth people that need somewhere to put their money where it wont lose value over time, and ideally gain value. If Bitcoin and other cryptos have better long term capital preservation properties than Real Estate, why not just put all your money into crypto? This would be a boon for diffuse value capture.

Things like S&P 500 ETFs and the Boglehead investing strategy can be seen as primitive forms of diffuse value capture fully aligned with mainstream capitalism. It's a way to diffusely capture value from the economy in aggregate with minimal bureaucracy and middlemen, whatever value you create but fail to capture, you can get some of it back through a broad market index.

The S&P 500 has a similar problem to Real Estate, it is used as a store of value and a way to beat inflation, so stocks of companies gain a monetary premium over their value as a speculative investment. This can artaficially inflate the market cap of companies and extend their life in the market after the have stopped inovating and have become stagnant burocracies. Is Apple after Steve Jobs really a good speculative investment with it's best days ahead of it in 2025 worthy of a 3.1T market cap?

The equity market has many more problems that work agaist diffuse value capture. Most of the best investment are not avaiable to the average person, private equity and venture captial gatekeep the best returns. Even today, the avergae American can't invest in most of the AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, retail investors that want AI exposure are forced into proxies like NVIDIA, but NVIDIA stock is a bet on their proprietary dirrect value capture strategy and not specificcly a bet on AI.

The TradFi equity market is closed, proprietary and gatekept by nature, with anciant and complicated infastructure that only work durring east coast bussines house. Of couse this is rationalized with appeals to authority, but to me it is clear that global captialism needs a new financial infastructure that is more open and diffuse.

In the US, inversorts are allowed to buy lottery tickets and gamle at casinos, but are protected from early acess to startup equity supposidly for their own good. The whole TradFi system is simply too closed, proprietary, and gatekept to facilitate diffuse value capture. 

After Bitcoins success, many more blockchains developed, with smart contracts and decentralized applications with the potental to move the traditional finance system. Diffuse value capture also needs a neutral sandbox where anyone can launch markets, organizations, and art without asking permission.

Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains take ideas from bitcoin and apply them to a more general purpose platforms for building and running decentralized applications. Where Bitcoin is like digital gold, Etherum is more of a public world computer.

 These systems are open and diffuse by design, just like computers are aligned with free information and copying by nature, and nerual networks are diffuse by nature, open-source decentralized blockchain platforms are diffuse by design.

Pepe the Frog is a prime example of the shift from direct to diffuse culture, and will without a doubt be studied in art history books for centuries to come.

In digital markets the marginal(additional) cost of producing the next unit often approaches zero. Once the first copy of a software package, video, or AI model exists, replicating it is basically free. Competitive forces, piracy, and open-source keep pushing selling prices toward that marginal cost, so the long-run price level for many goods is “free.”

When the price of digital goods aproches zero diffuse value capture becomes more effective than direct value capture. There are still incentives to produce the good if you have a diffuse net cast wide to capture value from adjacent products and services.

A fixed-supply digital asset like Bitcoin allows the economy to embrace tech-driven deflation instead of fighting it. As prices naturally fall to marginal cost, value doesn't disappear; it diffuses into cheaper goods, higher real wages, and shorter working hours. Any surplus productivity can accrue to holders of sound money rather than being siphoned off through money printing to finance debt.

You could argue from an austrian economics perspective that the prices of goods and services should fall as technology improves, but they don't because of the way money is created and controlled. Simply moving to something like a global Bitcoin monetary standard might be a major component of a diffuse value capture system.

Due to the internet and the personal computer, cultural production has moved from a read-only medium to a read-write medium.


## 8 Post-Authorship

The further you move in the direct value capture direction of the spectrum, the more you need to rely on your identity as a singular human to capture value. This is often at odds with how cultural production works in the real world.

In the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0, there was a lot of hype about commons-based peer production. The idea was that with the rise of the personal computer and the internet, we would see a new wave of cultural production that was not centered around the traditional gatekeeper model of hollywood and the music industry. Anyone online could colaborate with others to create new works of art.

When direct value capture is your goal, your identity as a singular human becomes extremely important. You are the center of the universe. You are the source of all value. You are the one who is entitled to capture the value created by others.

</div>

Trying to capture as much value as possible usually doesn't work well in the free market. An example I often use is that of font designers selling proprietary fonts with complicated and expensive licensing. This direct value capture strategy leads to extreme beliefs about authorship and originality, when in reality, the design of fonts is extremely memetic and every design is a remix of other designs. A truly unique font design that isn't built on a mountain of prior work and free and open-source software is almost impossible to find.



The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible information is effectively infinite in supply, making it difficult to price, and easy to copy. Early attempts at digital monetization try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM, technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course unethically restrict the free flow of information.

Distributed authorship is the future because it's a direct consequence of technological trends, as all culture follows from: increased dominance of decentralized content distribution networks over traditional media, massively accelerated AI content production built on a remix paradigm, hyperfinancialization blurring leisure/consumption and labor/creation online, all work to erode the artificial attempts to extend the pre-digital one-to-many media paradigm surviving now only through the dubiously defensible and ethically incoherent distortions of IP/copyright law pushed by legacy media companies and the vague pseudomarxist anti-AI youth political movement, both against the heavier political weight of the tech industry; not to mention rising Chinese soft power and global financial multipolarity. I've argued this is the future of culture for a decade because these trends were all obvious a decade ago and it's now so obvious today it feels trite to repeat, yet here we are. This isn't about political will or preferences; information "wants" to be free like water wants to flow down, it's a constant unerring unidirectional force that never gets reversed with each barrier it breaches. Attempts to restrict the internet—global networking, open content distribution, digital free association, runaway self-organizing culture—may slow it down, but it never succeeds in stopping it in any timeline.

## 9 Incentivizing post-authorship commons-based peer production.

Working for your bags.

I naively still believe in the idea of commons based peer production.

AI systems are trained on everything. Books, articles, code, images. They digest the entire cultural legacy of humanity and produce new works based on statistical patterns. They don't cite sources. They don't pay royalties. They just remix on a massive scale.

This feels like a return to pre-industrial models of cultural production, but with new technological infrastructure. Reputation and attribution matter more than exclusive control. Value capture becomes diffuse rather than direct.

With AI and crypto, we're moving toward systems where value capture aligns better with value creation. You contribute to the commons, and the commons finds ways to support you. Not through monopoly rights, but through attribution mechanisms, micropayments, reputation systems.
