# Bunny Pyx

Introducing Bunny Pyx, an open-source paint program designed specifically for kids that takes inspiration from the classic Kid Pix and QBasic. What makes Bunny Pyx special is that it's not just a tool for creating digital artâ€”it's also a learning platform for young coders to explore Python programming.

## The Inspiration Behind Bunny Pyx

Kid Pix was revolutionary when it was released in the early 1990s. It made digital art creation accessible and fun for children with its playful interface, surprising sound effects, and creative tools. Similarly, QBasic introduced many people to programming with its straightforward syntax and immediate visual feedback.

Bunny Pyx aims to capture that same sense of playful discovery while bringing it into the modern era of coding education.

## Features

- Simple, child-friendly interface with large buttons and clear icons
- Classic drawing tools: pencil, brush, fill, shapes, text, and erasers
- Fun sound effects that respond to different drawing actions
- Special effects and stamps that kids will enjoy
- Modular code structure designed to be easily understood and modified
- Extensive documentation written for beginners
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux)

## Learning Through Modification

The core philosophy behind Bunny Pyx is that children learn best when they can see immediate results from their code changes. The application is structured so that even beginners can:

- Add new brush types with just a few lines of code
- Create custom stamps or stickers
- Modify color palettes
- Add new sound effects
- Design simple animations
- Create new special effects filters

Each module is thoroughly documented with explanations suitable for young programmers, making it an ideal first project to modify.

## Getting Started

Bunny Pyx requires Python 3.7+ and uses Pygame for its graphics capabilities. Installation is straightforward:

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install bunny-pyx

# Or run directly from source
git clone https://github.com/username/bunny-pyx
cd bunny-pyx
python -m bunnypyx
```

## Educational Resources

The project includes:

- Step-by-step tutorials for making your first modifications
- Challenges of increasing difficulty to guide learning
- Classroom-ready lesson plans for educators
- Visual debugging tools that help understand what the code is doing

## Community and Sharing

We're building a community space where kids can share their Bunny Pyx artwork as well as their code modifications. This peer learning environment encourages both artistic creativity and coding skills.

## Future Development

Bunny Pyx is just getting started, and we have exciting plans for its future:

- Web export functionality to share creations online
- Animation capabilities 
- Simple game creation tools
- Mobile device support
- Collaborative drawing features

## Join the Bunny Pyx Community

Whether you're a parent looking for a creative coding outlet for your child, an educator seeking teaching tools, or an adult who wants a nostalgic yet educational experience, we invite you to hop in and try Bunny Pyx.
