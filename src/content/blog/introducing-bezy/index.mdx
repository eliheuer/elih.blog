## Introducing Bezy

A new free & open-source cross-platform font editor with a built in bidirectional multi-buffer text editor.

Following in the tradition of RoboFont, FontForge, Runebender, and MFEK, Bezy is a new font editor built for customization. Built in Rust using a game engine and architected for CLI workflows and AI integration, this cross-platform editor delivers the performance and aesthetic experience needed for type designers to stay in a creative flow state.

For educators and students, Bezy transforms the font editor from a black box into a transparent learning environment. We reject the walled-garden approach of prosumer software. When designers spend hours daily with professional tools, that time should foster growth and understanding—not dependency.

The editor features groundbreaking support for RTL scripts. Unlike editors that retrofitted RTL support, Bezy was architected from day one with bidirectional type design in mind, featuring a multi-buffer text editor and variable-width glyph grid, designed to meet the unique demands of global script design and font engineering.

Bezy embraces human-AI collaboration as a core principle. Through integration with tools like Claude Code, designers can extend functionality without deep programming expertise, thanks to an architecture built for AI-assisted workflows. Rust's exceptional tooling, documentation, and community ethos lower the barrier to customization compared to currently available alternatives. In-editor local and remote AI model integration is planned for 2026.

This talk will demonstrate Bezy's core innovations: its game-engine-powered interface delivering responsive, game-like interactions; its education-first architecture where editing source code and making your own tools becomes an empowering learning opportunity; and its novel approach to sustainable open-source development through blockchain-based community incentives.

Bezy aims to create a new paradigm for professional-quality libre graphics tools that not only equal proprietary software but vastly outperform them in quality, features, innovation, user equity, and new models of revenue generation. This is a tool built for a new computing era where programming literacy is a universal 21st-century skill.
