    <p>I have been experimenting with new business models for independent libre (open source) font development recently. I had my first hint that these models might work when my project <a href="https://gtl.world">GTL Type Label</a> minted all 100 editions of its first <a href="https://create.zora.co/editions/0xb013e4f218760bb72f63f8d78a82b546c91897ef">font NFT</a>. Enough people have been curious about what I am doing since then that it seems like the right time to put some of my thinking around <a href="http://davelab6.github.io/matd-dissertation/dave_crossland_matd2008_dissertation.pdf">libre type</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> into an essay.</p>

    <p>I am not going into much detail here about the philosophy behind libre type and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">why I sometimes use the word ‚Äúlibre‚Äù instead of ‚Äúopen source‚Äù</a>, but I think that the cultural nature of typefaces, and the way they lend themselves to being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">forked</a> to create new typefaces, makes fonts uniquely well suited to be licensed under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> license like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License">OFL</a>. Two documents are foundational to my thinking about licensing for font software and are recommended reading for anyone who wants to better understand my perspective:</p>
    <p>1: <a href="http://davelab6.github.io/matd-dissertation/">Dave Crossland's 2008 University of Reading MATD Dissertation</a></p>
    <p>2: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">Richard Stallman's 1985 GNU Manifesto.</a></p>
    <p>I am not a free software <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html">maximalist</a>, and I am well aware of the shortcomings of the ideas from the above documents in practice, as well as the problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license">permissively licensed</a> open-source software around value capture for developers and software freedom for users. Without my experiences and disappointments with the reality of open-source software development, I am not sure if I ever would have become interested in <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a>. What attracted me to this space was a culture interested in solving many of the misaligned incentives in <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/">web2</a>. Specifically, projects like <a href="https://gitcoin.co">GitCoin</a>, and concepts like <a href="https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html">Hyperstructures</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3YQw15JK7Q">NFTs</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dao">DAOs</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/jzhycnEuJq4">quadratic funding</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">retroactive public goods funding</a> were all very interesting to me as I fell down the crypto rabbit hole.</p>

    <p>Below is the tweet announcing the first font NFT from <a href="https://gtl.world/">GTL</a>. The image associated with the NFT is a black and white specimen showing the typeface <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/GTL001">GTL001</a> at its <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/GTL001/releases/tag/Alpha">alpha release</a>. The image was created with a Python script using <a href="https://github.com/justvanrossum/drawbot-skia">DrawBot-Skia</a>, a version of <a href="https://www.drawbot.com">DrawBot</a> that works on Linux. The script is included in the <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/GTL001/blob/main/documentation/Alpha-NFT.py">GTL001 Git repository</a> if you want to use it or just take a look at how the image was made. The auxiliary monospace text is set in <a href="https://github.com/eliheuer/hasubi-mono">Hasubi Mono</a>, an Arabic/Latin monospace typeface I designed, which I am currently preparing for a release on Google Fonts.
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ú®My first font NFT is now minting on Zora!<br><br>It is a specimen of the alpha release, so think of it like a rookie card for a typeface.<br><br>The font is open source and licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.<br><br>Mint link: <a href="https://t.co/gRImiAn73r">https://t.co/gRImiAn73r</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ihy8QsjPpd">pic.twitter.com/Ihy8QsjPpd</a></p>&mdash; elih.eth (@eliheuer) <a href="https://twitter.com/eliheuer/status/1553237369402183680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <p>What I am trying to do with this approach is to create two separate but linked goods with different economic properties, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">public good</a>, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good">veblen good</a>. Libre fonts are best understood in economic terms as public goods. Here is the definition of public goods from Wikipedia (also a public good):</p>
    <p>‚ÄúIn economics, a public good (also referred to as a social good or collective good) is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. For such goods, users cannot be barred from accessing or using them for failing to pay for them. Also, use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others. Therefore, the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person. This is in contrast to a common good, such as wild fish stocks in the ocean, which is non-excludable but rivalrous to a certain degree.‚Äù</p>

    <p>And the definition of a veblen good, also from Wikipedia:</p>
    <p>‚ÄúA Veblen good is a type of luxury good for which the demand increases as the price increases, in apparent (but not actual) contradiction of the law of demand, resulting in an upward-sloping demand curve. The higher prices of Veblen goods may make them desirable as a status symbol in the practices of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure. A product may be a Veblen good because it is a positional good, something few others can own.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Ether (ETH), the native token used by the Ethereum blockchain, is itself sometimes considered a veblen good. As I am writing this, The Ethereum main-net merge, which will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by 99.95%, has been tentatively scheduled for around September 15th/16th 2022. The price of ETH earlier this year was around $1000 briefly, but with the merge date confirmed and the final test-net merge compleated, the price has grown to around $2000. I bought some ETH around $1000 (not nearly enough I now realize) but now at $2000, my desire to buy ETH is much greater due to the increasing price indicating that other people want to own it. There is a fear of missing out as the price rises that does not exist right after a crash in the price of ETH, the same dynamic plays out with NFT floor prices.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the software that runs Ethereum is a public good, this is the origin of the public/veblen good concept for me. The Ethereum ecosystem even uses a lot of copyleft licenses instead of permissive licenses. Notably Go Ethereum AKA ‚Äúgeth‚Äù, Solidity (the smart contract programming language), and the Uniswap protocol are licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. There is a saying that when you adopt crypto, you adopt crypto values, so copyleft money and the oportunity it provides, might be a good way to getting more people to care about copyleft values. For example, the Monotype Helvetica NFTs feel a bit akward beacuse Monotype's practice of tightly controling intelectual propery does not align well with the open, colaboritve, and meme driven culture of crypto.</p>
    <p>If a font released under the public/veblen good model becomes a meme or gets a lot of use, the alpha release specimen might be worth something as a collectible. This would reward people who originally minted the NFT and give them a stake in seeing the typeface become widely used and well known. The fact that font files can be copied easily becomes an advantage in this model, the more people that have the font files, the better. A designer might have a portfolio of OFL font NFTs and would be financially motivated to use those fonts well and help them become popular or infamous. The goal is to create a positive-sum game between type designers and users. If the font doesn't go anywhere after the alpha release mint, it is a relatively inexpensive NFT (GTL001 was 0.009ETH) that is a public receipt (viewable from web3 apps like Rainbow or Zora) for funding independent open-source software development. Besides just a floor price, a sign-in-with-Ethereum button on a website allows for token-gated content.</p>

    <p>Ideally, font NFTs could create better incentives for contributing to libre font projects and encourage collaboration. A NFT holder might make issues on the Git repository for a font project hoping the floor price will go up or even make pull requests improving the source files and other parts of the repository. Or a group of people wanting to make new fonts for a script not well served by the traditional font industry could form a DAO funded by NFT sales.</p>
    <p>The final paragraph of Dave Crossland's thesis almost seems to predict a positive-sum business model like this emerging:</p>
    <p>‚ÄúWhile today‚Äôs professionals use proprietary business models, the biggest problem facing new type designers is obscurity. Treating customers as friends rather than thieves and type design as a service instead of a product may prove an effective way for newcomers to enter the market while reinforcing a free society in the age of computer networks.‚Äù</p>

    <p>I realize buying an NFT for a font that can be downloaded for free from a Git host might still seem insane to some people. Especially people looking at web3 from the outside, but imagine if no one had thought of proprietary font licensing as we know it today and tried to introduce it in 2022. It might seem strange to pay for an infinitely copyable font file, and then not have the ability to resell the license on a secondary market or make changes to the font to suit your own needs. Maybe font NFTs and proprietary font licenses are equally absurd ideas, one just seems normal because it is familiar and established.</p>
